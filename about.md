The Zen of Simple

Simple code is beautiful, easy to understand, well documented. You don't have to guess what it does, and it's always a pleasure to change it, own it, share it.

Simple processes don't create entropy. They become automatic, flow freely, do not impose themselves on you.

Simple people just know how to love, and share, and do their best. They are humble and tolerant, always ready to help. They learn from others, are proactive and enthusiastic. They don't carry heavy burdens of preconceptions and safe old ways, therefore they adapt easily to new realities.

Simple companies are focused on the vision, and on the people that make that vision a reality every day.

My mission is Simple.

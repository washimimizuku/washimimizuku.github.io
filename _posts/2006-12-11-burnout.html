title: Burnout

<i>"Burnout is a psychological term for the experience of long-term exhaustion and diminished interest (depersonalisation or cynicism), usually in the work context."</i> (taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29">Wikipedia</a>)<br /><br />Burnout is something I have been thinking about recently, specially because that's the way I feel right now about my job. And today, in <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/">The Tao of Mac</a>, I found a link to a very interesting article on Burnout: <a href="http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Where+Work+Is+a+Religion%2C+Work+Burnout+Is+Its+Crisis+of+Faith+--+New+York+Magazine&amp;expire=&amp;urlID=20309214&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2F24757%2F&amp;partnerID=73272">Canâ€™t Get No Satisfaction</a>. It helped me process some thoughts...

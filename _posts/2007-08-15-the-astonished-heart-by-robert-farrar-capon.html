title: The Astonished Heart by Robert Farrar Capon
---

Tha Astonished Heart is a critical analysis of the history of the church, and a very profetic one. The author explores the goods and bads of all the phases of the history of the church in terms of religiosity, institutionalism, and catholicity (universality), giving a very good perspective of what really matters in the end.<br /><br />What I really liked about this book is that it gives you a very good insight and a new perspective of how the church developed through the ages, and what were the consequences of those changes. It really opened my eyes for a lot of new thinking.<br /><br />In the end, the analysis focus on the models of church we have in our days, the good and bad they have, and other models that the church is not adopting yet (or better, was not adopting in 1995, when the book was written). And then it finishes with hope that we recover the astonishing ability of the gospel.<br /><br />In the end, this was a very good book, and a very easy one to read. I love when theology is explained with a sense of humor.

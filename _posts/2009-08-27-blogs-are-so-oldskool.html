title: Blogs are so oldskool
---

The new generation doesn't care about big texts. Small texts rule. They will more easily use <a href="http://twitter.com/nbarr">twitter</a>, <a href="http://nbarr.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>, <a href="http://blip.fm/EmergingBirder">blip.fm</a>, or something similar. Specially if it runs in mobile phones.<br /><br />I have seen several people abandon their blogs for this kind of communication, and not all of them were that young. That will happen more and more. My blog is going to continue, but it will be rethinked in the near future...

title: Genève for a long time
---

It's official: I got a job in Genève, and will start working on November 15th. Very exciting :)<br /><br />This will be a great change for me and Paula, and we expect some hard times adapting to this new reality. But well, that's the place we felt we belonged. Let's see what God has in store for us.<br /><br />Some of the projects I'll be part of are:<br /><br />- <a href="http://shemacommunity.typepad.com">Shema</a>, a christian community<br />- <a href="http://www.engage-geneva.com">Engage</a>, an interesting social project<br />- <a href="http://fr.arocha.org/suisse/">A Rocha Switzerland</a>, a Christian Environmental project

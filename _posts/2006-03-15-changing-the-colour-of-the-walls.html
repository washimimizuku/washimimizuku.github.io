title: Changing the colour of the walls
---

Critique without alternatives is pointless. It's easy to fall on that trap. We see what is wrong about church, and we star criticizing everything, but then we don't know how to solve those problems.<br /><br />You know, problems are visible. They are there, they can be analised, studied, dissected, and we can reach do definite conclusions: "The problem with church is that the colour of the walls is white! Because of that, we can't see the angels around us!"<br /><br />Solutions, are invisible. OK, the colour is wrong, because angels are the same colour, and so we can't see them. But then, what's the best colour? Black makes the best contrast, but maybe creates other problems. No one likes black walls! (Actually there are <strike>2</strike> some people who do, but that's not the point)<br /><br />We need to find out what is wrong, and there are many things wrong. But we also need to  think on how to improve matters. Or else, we'll spend all our lifes complaining, and getting nowhere.

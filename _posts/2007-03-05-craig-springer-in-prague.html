title: Craig Springer in Prague
---

I met Craig yesterday in a <a href="http://lisboamatrix.typepad.com/">Lisboa Matrix</a> meeting, and he is a great guy. I really felt connected with him and what he was doing in Prague, and I pray that God will raise a community of faith through his work.<br /><br />Get to know more about his (and his wife who I haven't met yet) work in their website, the <a href="http://www.springerfamilyjourney.com/">Springer Family Journey</a>. Please pray for them and/or support them in some other way.

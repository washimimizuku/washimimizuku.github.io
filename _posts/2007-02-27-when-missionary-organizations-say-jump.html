title: When missionary organizations say jump
---

Most of the visits I get to my blog in the English version is thanks to a series of articles I wrote almost a year ago, called "When missionary organizations say jump". It's a series about what to avoid when becoming a missionary, and many have linked to it before, most notably, <a href="http://marcsmessages.typepad.com/mm/2006/04/so_you_wannabee.html">Marc</a>.<br /><br />I noticed now that there is no index in my blog for all the articles, so here it is:<br /><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=595">An introduction</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=596">Being prepared</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=599">No Jeans</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=600">Rosetta stone</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=611">Where is everyone?</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=618">We are family</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=620">My own bubble</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=623">Follow the money</a><br />- <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=625">Time to go</a>

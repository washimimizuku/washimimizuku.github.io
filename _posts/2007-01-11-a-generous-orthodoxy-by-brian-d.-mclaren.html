title: A Generous Orthodoxy by Brian D. McLaren
---

Everyone has already read this book. Or so it seems. I'll start by saying that I really liked the book, and most of it resonates what I have been feeling and thinking in the last year and a half.<br /><br />Generous Orthodoxy is all about respect. Respecting other cultures, traditions, religions, etc. It's about looking to the past of the church, and understanding what good came from it. It's about being humble, admitting that we suck big time, that we may be wrong in many things. We are better than no one. It's all about the kingdom of God. It's all about having the courage of pressing forward, following Christ and sharing Him with others, despite our weaknesses.<br /><br />Because of all this, the fate of this book is to be a polemic one. There is no way this book could pass unharmed. The Church of our days is filled with quarrels for one simple reason: We all think we are right and the other wrong. So, this book comes against the Praxis of today's Church. Against our arrogance, against our hypocrisy. So, it is no surprise to me that this book gather so much criticism, since it speaks so well of our Church wrongs.

title: 'When missionary organizations say jump: Where is everyone?'

Creating relationships and learning the language are the biggest problems you will face in a missionary field. Both are a question of time, but you have to start somewhere.<br /><br />Just think how you got to know the people you know. Maybe you met them in the neighborhood when you were a kid. Or maybe you met them in school, university, church, club, some place like that. But if you are working, probably most of the unbelievers you created a relationship with are co-workers.<br /><br />Well, when you are a missionary moving to a remote country, you can forget most of that options. You didn't grow up there, so there is no neighborhood or school friends. Church is not a good place to meet unbelievers (at least of the kind you are trying to reach), and since you are a missionary full time, there's no other co-workers you can meet (besides other missionaries).<br /><br />So, how do you meet people? From all the options above, there's only one way: clubs. More specifically, organizations where you can meet people that have the same interests/hobbies you have. I like bird watching, and I am enrolled in a portuguese association of bird watchers. And I met some people there. But none of them become strong relationships like the ones I have with my co-workers.<br /><br />And that's why, in my opinion, missionaries should get a job in the country where they go to, so that they are able to meet more people (and at the same time learn the language better). What kind of job? Something that helps you meet lots of people in a consistent way, and where you have plenty of opportunities to talk with them.<br /><br />So, you are being payed by a missionary organization, and working in a secular job doesn't please them very much? <strike>Dump them</strike> Try to do some voluntary social work. Many countries have organizations where you can enroll to do voluntary social work in a consistent way. Just don't go there saying "I'm a christian and I would like to help!" because it sounds like "I would like to use your organization to convert people to my religion". Some people like to brag about the fact that they belong to a christian organization, and then they wonder why people don't want them to help.<br /><br />Has a conclusion, if you want to create relationships, get a life. A normal life.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> There is much that could be said about forced evangelism and creating relationships or enrolling to organizations with a hidden agenda. I expect people who read my blog to understand that that sort of things is <b>wrong</b>. Some people even call it <b>manipulation</b>. I expect people to see this recomendations has an explanation of why missionaries have problems meeting people and how to avoid it, not as an explanation of how to infiltrate places to convert them. If you enroll a social organization, do it because you genuinely want to help people.

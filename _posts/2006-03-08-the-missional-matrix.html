title: The Missional Matrix

Rick posted about <a href="http://blindbeggar.org/?p=180">The Missional Matrix</a> quoting  Ed Stetzer:<br /><br /><i>"A missional church lives at the intersection of three things:<br /><br />- Who Jesus is and what he has sent us to do (Christology);<br />- What forms and strategies we should use to most effectively expand the kingdom where we are sent (Missiology);<br />- What expression of a New Testament church is most appropriate in this context (Ecclesiology)."</i><br /><br />Nice information to think about. Our life should be balanced in all this aspects. I believe the Christology and Ecclesiology parts are really neglected in the institutional church, and the Missiology is often mistargeted. I might be wrong. I hope I'm wrong.

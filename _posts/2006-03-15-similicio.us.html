I just found out about <a href="http://similicio.us/">similicio.us</a> in <a href="http://www.jasonclark.ws/jasonclark/2006/03/how_to_find_blo.html">Jason's</a> blog.<br /><br />Using del.icio.us bookmarks, it searches for websites related to the one you put in the search box. The process is quite simple, it looks for what the people who bookmarked that site are bookmarking to, and orders them by number of times they show up.

title: Pagan Christianity by Frank Viola
---

This is a hard title to digest. Pagan Christianity? Is it a new kind of pseudo-christianity mixed with the pagan beliefs of our days? No, that's not what this bookk talks about. As the subtitle says, this book is about "the origin of our church practices".<br /><br />This is an exaustive analysis of all the practices we see in a normal church of our days. Things like the order of service, semon, building, clergy, clothes, music, offerings, baptism, lord's supper and seminaries. All is scrutinized to the smaller detail possible. Where those practices come from? How they evolved? What's the consequences? Everything is studied in detail.<br /><br />This is a great book to accompany "Rethinking the wineskin" and "Who is your covering?" by the same author. If this book is read by itself, I think the point of this book will not be easily understood. But together with the other books, it serves as a strong foundation for many of what we read in them.<br /><br />While I read this book, I was many times amazed, other times angry with all the stupid errors I have been preacticing for a long time. This book really enlightened me in things I had no idea of. I really recommend this book, but be prepared to have your concept of church really shaken. The way you see church will never be the same...

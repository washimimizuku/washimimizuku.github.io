title: Global Warming is real
---

It makes me sad when I read news like this: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6648265.stm">Evangelicals split on global warming</a>. It's hard for me to cope with that. But I guess this is a product of the way christians put themselves against science, sometimes. Which in my opinion is completely dumb.<br /><br />There is no real scientist that says that Global Warming is not a product of our polution. And christians, knowing that earth was created by God, should be the firsts to help protect the earth. Protect life. Nature is, in a sense, weak, easily destroyed. And we are to protect the weak. Not only that, but the people most afected by the global warming are the poors, who we should also protect.<br /><br />I think we, as christians, should give the example in the protection of the environment, instead of denying the global warming for political and consumeristic reasons, two things that clearly go against the gospel.<br /><br />(seen <a href="http://blog.simon-cozens.org/post/view/1230">here</a>)

title: Axis & Allies
---

And don't know if any of you remember a board game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_and_Allies">Axis & Allies</a>. It's a game that brings me nice memories from my teenage years, when I would spend afternoons playing it with my friends. It's a great strategy game. It's best when played by 5 people (representing USA, UK, Russia, Germany and Japan), but can be played by 2-5 people. It has some similarities with Risk, but is much more complex. The original version was easier for the Allies, but the game suffered some revisions to make things more even.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://triplea.sourceforge.net/screen/battle-thumb.png" /></center><br />Yesterday I discovered <a href="http://triplea.sourceforge.net/mywiki">TripleA</a>, a Axis & Allies clone. It's made in Java 1.5, works in all the major operating systems (unix, mac os x and windows), and includes not only the traditional game, but also the revised editions and some new sets. You can play against the computer, against other players over the network, and even by email. I tried the unstable version and it works great (frozed once, but I was able to save the game and continue it later). And it's free!<br /><br />So, if anyone wants to play with me sometime, I'll be Japan :)

OK, this is probably old news by now, but I noticed today the website <a href="http://www.librarything.com">Library Thing</a>. Library Thing is a place to put all your books so that you have an easy reference to them. Because it's in the internet, you can see who else has the same books, which books they like, reviews made by other viewers, ratings, etc. From the people for the people.<br /><br />I like it, but I would like to see more community in it. I would like to name other people my contacts, and not only being able to watch their list. It's a social thing, we like to be connected to the people we know. We like to meet new people. We like to connect. We like to know who is connected to us (who is seeing our list).<br /><br />You can check out <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?view=nbarr">my list here</a>.

title: Direct access to God
---

<i>"We realized that churches where direct access to God is encouraged and that have a flat and personal relationship structure, rather than hierarchical structures, reflect the lives of people most contextually."</i> (<a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/rac/art_JHCe_01.html">Incarnational Approaches to the Japanese People using House Church Strategies</a>)<br /><br />We can't talk about direct access to God without organical flat structures, because hierarchical structures undermine that direct access. It is true that hierarchical structures don't force you to neglect your direct relationship with God, but it helps. People start depending on the leaders for prayer, teaching and advising. The pastor can say a thousand times from the pulpit that people should have direct access to God, but his hierarchical position undermines his own words.<br /><br />Instead of hierarchical structures, what the church needs is relational structures, where everyone acts (or try to) in love, humility and sumission on to the other. A real interdependent community, where no one is superior to the other, where everyone has something to give and receive. As equals before God and men.

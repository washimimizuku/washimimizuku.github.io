title: My Media Consumption Diet

André tagged me with this one. And he probably did that because <a href="http://simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=895">I hate being tagged</a>.<br /><br /><b>Web</b><br /><br />Web is my life. It's hard for me to be a whole day without internet, unless I'm doing bird watching. I am a web developer, so I make my living of the internet.<br /><br />I have a blog (yes, really). I use flickr a lot. I use Goggle Reader to follow 75 different blogs and news sites (after I reduced my list a lot). I also use the web to read the news.<br /><br /><b>Radio</b><br /><br />I listen to the radio when I'm driving. The rest of the time, radio has been almost completely obliterated by my iPod or Mac. Sometimes I hear radio in my microwave while I'm cooking.<br /><br /><b>TV</b><br /><br />I feel like TV is mostly made for mental retarded people, so I only watch TV when I'm feeling tired (which is similar to being retarded), or when there is a good movie or a good nature show. Beside that, I use the TV to watch DVDs and to play Nintendo Wii.<br /><br /><b>Movies</b><br /><br />I like good movies. I go to the movie theatre 1-2 times a month, and I own several DVDs I like to watch. Sometimes I rent movies.<br /><br /><b>Communication</b><br /><br />I use email and IM a lot. I'm almost always connected in some way. I also use a cellphone, but it's not my favourite means of communication.<br /><br /><b>Magazines</b><br /><br />I only subscribe National Geographic and Pardela (bird magazine from <a href="http://www.spea.pt">SPEA</a>). Besides does, I read what's available in the doctor's waiting room.<br /><br /><b>Books</b><br /><br />My personal library has about 1000 books. At least. I have a whole room for them. And yes, I've read most of them. Most of the books are christian-related books, and the rest are mostly technology books and Novels.<br /><br />I used to read a book each week, but in the last year I'm reading a lot less. I normally read in public transports and when I have free time.<br /><br /><b>Newspapers</b><br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, paper newspapers are dead. I only buy newspapers when they bring a nice DVD or something like that.<br /><br /><b>Music</b><br /><br />I use my iPod a lot. I have about 10 000 legal songs in my library. Yes, I actually pay for it. I hear it when I'm working, and in public transports.<br /><br />Music festivals are too loud for me.<br /><br /><b>Play</b><br /><br />Nintendo Wii all the way!<br /><br />I’m tagging no one. That's how subversive I am :)

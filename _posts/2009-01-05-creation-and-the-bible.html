<i>"I believe the Bible says that God created the heavens and the earth in six days. I also believe that rivers clap their hands and that mountains sing (Ps 98:8) because he Bible says that too. But I don't think that the Bible means six twenty-four-hour days any more than I believe that he Bible means that rivers have actual hands."</i> (Daniel M. Harrell in Natures Witness)

title: Basements

My holidays ended, and I am back from London. One thing I found interesting in London is that many of the churches have basements that are used for several purposes: coffee shops, and other interesting stuff. That got me thinking about the usefullness of the buildings. There are so many church buildings in Portugal that are only used in the sunday service, and stay closed the rest of the week. But the real church happens during the week, not in a sunday morning. The real church happens in the basements.

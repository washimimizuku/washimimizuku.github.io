title: Serve God, Save the Planet by J. Matthew Sleeth
---

This is a long overdue review. I finished reading this book some months ago.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.servegodsavetheplanet.org/">Serve God, Save the Planet</a> is a book that obviously caught my interest, since it talks about the two most important themes in my life: God and nature.<br /><br />The book starts by showing all the theoretical reasons why christians should be actively interested in protecting the environment, and it does accomplish that role really well. I wouldn't say it brings much new things for someone that understands both subjects as well as I do, but it is an excellent resume of all those reasons.<br /><br />After that, it turns into the practical consequences of those beliefs, and that's where I find the book a little bit lacking. Most practical aspects talked about are mainly in a personal level. More about what we can do alone in our house (mainly recycling and saving energy). But not much in how we should work to protect and restore natural habitats, or how we can politically intervene in those subjects. And it got a little bit boring by the end, with so many small things we can do.<br /><br />But overall, I think it is a great book as an introduction to this subject, and worth a read. I would offer one to people interested but with no clue about the subject.

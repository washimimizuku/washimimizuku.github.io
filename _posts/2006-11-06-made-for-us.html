We can look at a sunset, and feel awed by its beauty. We look at a butterfly, and we smile. We don't see other animals doing that. Only humans.<br /><br />All this beauty was created for us. It was a special gift from God that renews each day. When we neglect nature, this precious gift he made, we are neglecting God himself. We are saying his gift is not important to us. And I bet that saddens God.

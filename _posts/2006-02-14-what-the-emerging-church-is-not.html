title: What the emerging church is not
---

Today, Andrew Jones wrote a very interesting article in his blog: <a href="http://tallskinnykiwi.typepad.com/tallskinnykiwi/2006/02/what_i_would_sa.html">what i would say to the young american emerging churches</a>. I have had to deal with the same problem several times, the wrong idea people have about the emerging church given by some churches that call themselves emergent.<br /><br /><i>"The emerging church, if i listen to the more extreme critics, is just about changing the style of church to attract people and keeping them happy, of accepting any wind of doctrine without critique, of finding the coolest hippest trends and adopting them in a sunday service. Of being postmodern to attract postmoderns. Of careless adoption of any ancient practice regardless of its origin or affect, of finding identity in protest against the Modern, Enlightenment or Constantinian models of church."</i><br /><br />As he says in the article, that has nothing to do with the emerging church. A very good post to read. A critique to some "emergent churches" and a good description of what the emerging church is not.

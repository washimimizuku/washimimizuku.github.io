title: Dvorak, just say NO!
---

When people offer you drugs, just say NO. Or else you'll end up like Dvorak writing articles that say that <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1923151,00.asp">Apple will dump OS X and use Microsoft Windows instead</a>. Drugs are really bad for your mental health.<br /><br />Dvorak, just say NO.

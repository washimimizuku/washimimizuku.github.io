Just finished watching the movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqxENMKaeCU">Home</a>. Its filled with great imagery of our planet, while explaining how everything came to be, and how we are destroying all that. It finishes with a message of hope, and a call to action. I really enjoyed it.

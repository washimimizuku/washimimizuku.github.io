title: Pacifism and christianity

<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_4_67/ai_99818481">This Stanley Hauerwas profile</a> is an old article, but one that deserves some revisiting.<br /><br />"Being Christian and being a pacifist are not two things for me. I would not be a pacifist if I were not a Christian, and I find it hard to understand how one can be a Christian without being a pacifist." (Stanley Hauerwas)<br /><br />I could not agree more with him. The way of Christ is the way of peace. And like him, I don't believe in pacifism because I am not violent. The opposite is true. The way he says it is like this: "I'm a pacifist because I'm a violent son of a b****." If the human being was not violent, there was no need to be a pacifist.

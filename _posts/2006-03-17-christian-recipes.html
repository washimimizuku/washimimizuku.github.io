title: Christian recipes

There are no christian recipes. But you know, if the church kept doing the Lord's Supper like a complete meal until our days, things would be really different. This is what would happen:<br /><br />- We would have plenty of "christian recipes" (rabbit Ã  la S. Augustine, and stuff like that)<br />- The way meals evolved in society would be different. Maybe it would be normal to eat with all your neighbours frequently?<br />- Christians would have great cooks. Maybe cooking would become a ministry? With hierarchy and all?<br />- Instead of "The sermon was really good, the pastor was inspired!", we would hear "The food was marvelous! This cook is really anointed by God!"<br /><br />More suggestions welcomed.

<a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com"><img src="http://www.storyofstuff.com/banners/217x188_SoS_Banner005.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/">The Story of Stuff</a> is an excellent film that talks about... stuff! But specially the effect stuff, and specially consuming stuff, has on all the world. What it means to the environment, to the people, to the third world, to the rich world, and to each one of us.<br /><br />The film take 20 minutes, but it's worth it. It is the best explication I have ever seen. Tanks to <a href="http://companion.blogs.com/">Lammert</a> for the link.

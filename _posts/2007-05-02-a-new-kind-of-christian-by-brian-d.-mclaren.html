title: A New Kind of Christian by Brian D. McLaren
---

I started to read the "A New Kind of Christian" trilogy some weeks ago, and have now finished the first book.<br /><br />I really liked the book for two main reasons. First, because it speaks about the core issues needing reformation in modern christianity (not the less meaningful exterior things). And second, because the approach used (fictional story) is a very smart way of talking about things that may hurt others.<br /><br />This is an excellent book to give to that special friend that has problems understanding what that emerging stuff is all about. Because sometimes we focus to much on the superficial things, on the results, and forget to show all the meaningful reasons that led us to live christianity in a new way.<br /><br />This is also an excellent book for all who find Christ interesting, but the modern church not so interesting. There are other ways of being church, of being christians, that are more appealing to outsiders.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the other two books...

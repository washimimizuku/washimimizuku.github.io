title: Organic Church by Neil Cole
---

Organic Church is a very practical book on how to missional and incarnational "where life happens". The model of waiting for people to come to church clearly doesn't work, what we need is to do what we were allways suposed to do: Go where people are and communicate the Gospel there.<br /><br />To do so, we need to reduce the Gospel to its absolute minimum (which means take of all the garbage we added to it), and communicate it in a way that people can easily pass to others. The result is a chrisitan movement.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. It's very practical and filled with real life experiences.

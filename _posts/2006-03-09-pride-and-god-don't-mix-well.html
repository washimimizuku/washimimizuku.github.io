title: Pride and God don't mix well
---

John wrote a very nice article on <a href="http://johnalanturner.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-god-doesnt-like-pride.html">Why God Doesn't Like Pride</a>.<br /><br /><i>"God is not opposed to pride because it is something only he can possess; God is opposed to pride because pride is unlike him."</i>

title: Boss or Leader?
---

Being a boss is much easier than being a leader. A real leader inspires people. A real leader motivates people. A real leader finds the gifts of each one and helps them find the best way to use them. A real leader shares all happy and sad moments. A real leader creates relationships with his followers. A real leader is an example to his followers, and instead of telling how to do, shows how to do.<br /><br />The boss, on the other hand, only has to tell people what to do.<br /><br />Churches should have leaders, not bosses.

title: Genève for the weekend
---

I'll be in Genève next weekend. Some of the main reasons are:<br /><br />- Go to the "Footprints of Hope" conference by <a href="http://fr.arocha.org/suisse/">A Rocha</a><br />- Get to know my brothers at <a href="http://shemacommunity.typepad.com/">Shema</a><br />- Job interview in a cool place<br /><br />Let's see how everything works out. I'm trying to keep my expectations low, but it's hard :)

title: The next big revolution in computer hardware
---

Yesterday Samsung <a href="http://www.samsung.com/PressCenter/PressRelease/PressRelease.asp?seq=20060523_0000257520">anounced</a> two computers with NAND flash disks. In my opinion, this is the next big revolution in computer hardware.<br /><br />This is big news for computer users. Most of the speed problems we feel today are disk related, and flash disks are much faster than the "normal" ones. Not only that, but they are smaller, lighter and consume less energy, addressing most of the portable problems. On the other hand, it's a lot more expensive :)<br /><br />Don't expect to see it in all computers soon, for now you'll have to pay dearly for it. But I just can't wait to see it coming in a MacBook. That will be sweet!

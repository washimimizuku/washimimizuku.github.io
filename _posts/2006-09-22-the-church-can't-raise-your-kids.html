title: The Church Can't Raise Your Kids
---

John Alan Turner just wrote an excelent article called <a href="http://blog.faith20.org/?p=454">The Church Canâ€™t Raise Your Kids</a>. It is so true. It's not the church that is responsible to raise your children, it's you.<br /><br />It makes me think of those that are tired of the institution, but stay there because of sunday school. Their reason is that if they start meeting in homes, their kids will not be properly raised because there will be no sunday school. In my eyes, that's a weird reason.

title: Red-crested Pochard (Netta rufina)
---

This weekend I went to Quinta do Lago, south of Portugal, and photographed plenty of Red-crested Pochards. They must be one of the most beautifull duck species. This diving duck is not very common in Portugal, and the only place I've seen them is in Quinta do Lago. But they can probably be seen in other parts of Ria Formosa.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/118772994/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/118772994_2735ec50ee_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Pato-de-bico-vermelho (Netta rufina)" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/118772980/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/52/118772980_7badbdc12b_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Pato-de-bico-vermelho (Netta rufina)" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/118772945/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/118772945_7696ecd73b_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Pato-de-bico-vermelho (Netta rufina)" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/118772936/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/37/118772936_615a86c8f6_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Pato-de-bico-vermelho (Netta rufina)" /></a><br /><br />It was really fun to see one of the males having a hard time defending his female, since the other males were trying to take her from him. Once he did the mistake of diving, and then had a hard time flying after her (and the pursuing males) all around the lake. I couldn't photograph that, But I fotographed one of the runs he gave to another male:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/118772964/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/48/118772964_a4903c8910_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Pato-de-bico-vermelho (Netta rufina)" /></a>

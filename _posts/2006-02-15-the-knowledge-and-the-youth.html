title: The knowledge and the youth
---

When we are young, we think that the important thing to obtain is the knowledge. That as we get knowledge, we evolve.<br /><br />It is true that knowledge is important, and is something we should search for, but it doesn't substitute experience. And as we get older, we start valuing experience even more. We start to understand that this world is made of ever changing relationships, unexpected things, and our knowledge changes constantly with the experiences we have.<br /><br />Then we get to a point where we prefer to savour all the experiences we can, instead of letting the books give us the knowledge others obtained from their experience. And thats when we are really capable of attain the knowledge given by the books.

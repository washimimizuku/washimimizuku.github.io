title: Learning from Open Source Conferences
---

There are many things to learn from <a href="http://www.yapc.org/">YAPC</a>, a Perl conference. In YAPC, besides having some big names invited, anyone can sugest a talk, and if accepted by the organizers, the person will become one of the speakers, having the oportunity to present his talk. This is as grass roots as it can get.<br /><br />What we need is for our conferences to be a place where everyone has a chance to be heard, to express their gifts, instead of only letting the big names speak. The church is made of all of us, not only of a select elite.<br /><br />It would be great to have a christian conference where everyone has room to share what God has been teaching them. I think it's urgent to create something like that.

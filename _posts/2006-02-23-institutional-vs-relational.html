title: Institutional vs Relational
---

<i>"Far from being a body or a family, the church for most of us is an organization or an institution. The contrast between the institutional shape of the contemporary church and the relational shape of the first-century church could hardly be more striking."</i> (Hal Miller)<br /><br />Something got lost in the process. Slowly the church reshaped from a relational community to a hierarchical institution. Relationships in the church of today is but a dim image of what it once was.<br /><br />Trying to experience the same presence of God the early church did without experiencing the same practices, is like trying to experience the power of F1 cars with a bicycle. It's just not possible to experience it completely inside the institutionalized church. We have to rethink the practice of the church, making it more subject to Jesus, if we want to experience his presence.

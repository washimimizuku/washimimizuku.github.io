title: The Celtic Way of Evangelism by Geroge G. Hunter III
---

I saw this book first in some emergent weblog, and that got me interested in it. So, recently, I amazoned it, and finished reading it on my extended 3 week vacations (Yes, I'm the lucky one).<br /><br />I'll start by saying that the book ia a good one to read, worth the money, etc. His point is that the celtic way of evangelism is the best way to reach the postmodern culture of today. And I would kind of agree with it, since celtic christians were cool guys that I would like to hang around with. But maybe what should be said is that Hunter's interpretation of celtic christianity way of evangelism is probably the best way to reach them.<br /><br />Some of the things he says gets you thinking how he could know that the celts did it that way. It gets you the feeling that Hunter has an idea of how evangelism should be done in our days, and then goes on showing (or demanding) that the celtic christians did it the same way. But thats just a small part of it.<br /><br />Most of it is in solid foundation, and describes lots of greart ideas and concepts to evangelize the people of our days. And the best thing, there is theory, but there is also practice. The best book on evangelism I read this year (but then, it was the only one).

title: The Lord's cup
---

<i>"In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.'"</i> (Luke 22:20)<br /><br />Was the drink in Jesus cup wine or non-fermented grape juice? Well, I have heard some deep theological opinions on this. That the Jews didn't have anything fermented in the Passover, so it couldn't be wine. And the word translated wine can mean both wine or non-fermented grape juice.<br /><br />Well, there is no point in this discussion. Grape juice has to be drinked right after it is made, if not, it will ferment and become wine. And since the grape seasonis  in Autumn, it's impossible for them to have had non-fermented grape juice in April (the month of passover). So, it had to be wine.<br /><br />On the other hand, is this really important? I mean, if we say it has to be wine, then alcoholics can't participate on it. Could we do the Lord's Supper with orange juice? I think so. What do you think?

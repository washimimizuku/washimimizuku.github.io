<i>"If the electricity went out, and your walls fell down, and your biggest givers died, what would you have left? Would you have a community of people still seeking after the heart of God? Would you still worship even without a band? Would you still be able to learn about God even though you can't show a video or a PowerPoint slide? In other words, what you have when everything else goes away is what your church is really all about."</i><br /><br />(Seen <a href="http://whatspastisprologue.blogspot.com/2006/03/what-if.html">here</a>, original <a href="http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2006/02/i_am_often_aske.html">here</a>)

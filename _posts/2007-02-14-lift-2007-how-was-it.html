title: 'Lift 2007: How was it'

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/457019396/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/253/457019396_7685f4c205_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Nice screen" align="left" /></a>I had a great time at <a href="http://www.liftconference.com">Lift 2007</a>. It was a great way to stop a little bit and think strategically. And even I, who have an hard time socializing, got to know several interesting people, and got lots of great ideas for some of the projects I have in mind.<br /><br />I loved the way Lift was organized. Specially the way the sessions were intercalated with mingling time and party time. It's where you really get to know other people. What best than a fondue session to get along?<br /><br />We had some problems with WIFI, specially in the first day. And the food was really bad (in portuguese standards, which applies to every non-portuguese food in the planet). But the rest worked really well. I loved the snake game in the lobby, I loved the conference rooms, I loved the informality, I really loved the movie with the names of the speakers, and I loved the croissants in the morning.<br /><br />What did I bring? More than knowledge, I brought vision and connections. And that's what's really all about, right?

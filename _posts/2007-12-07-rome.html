title: Rome

I spent all day thinking about the following quotes today, applying it to church:<br /><br />"There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile." (Gladiator movie)<br /><br />"Is Rome worth one good man's life? We believed it once. Make us believe it again." (Gladiator movie)<br /><br />Someone made me think about them. You know, I've been in this emergent, familiar, simple, communal, missional, apostolical, whatever church thing for the past 4 years. But until today, it's still a dream to come true. A dream I still need to fully comprehend. A dream for which I still pay dearly every day I live. I refuse to give up on this dream, it's too important.

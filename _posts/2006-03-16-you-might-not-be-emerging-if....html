title: You might not be emerging if...
---

An interesting list by Peter: <a href="http://meltingearth.com/P3T3RK3Y5/2006/03/you-might-not-be-emerging-if.html">You might not be emerging if</a>.<br /><br />I specially like this ones:<br /><br />- you think or act as if numbers are important<br />- your future has a dependency on a building or buildings<br />- preaching / a message, sans discussion, is standard fare<br />- *doing* kingdom work is valued more than *being* the kingdom<br />- dialogue, particularly negative feedback, is avoided - rather than welcomed

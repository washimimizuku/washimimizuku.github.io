title: Windows Media Photo
---

Microsoft has just anounced a new image format called <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0605/06052901windowsmediaphoto.asp">Windows Media Photo</a>. They claim it is much better than JPEG, with ratios closer to JPEG 2000 but without the heavy computational requirements. The new format will be available when Windows Vista arrives (will it be this century?), when there will be a XP version.<br /><br />I predict this format to be allready dead. The guys from Microsoft allways forget the standard thing. They make closed formats so that people are tied to it. But if that worked in the older days, it doesn't anymore. No camera manufacturer is going to adopt something that is not standard. So, in the end, this will be as usefull as the JPEG 2000 is. Or even less...

title: Learning japanese
---

I have been learning japanese for some months now. And while I advise people to learn in classes, if you are interested, there are some free online resources you can use.<br /><br />You should start to learn the two main alphabets of the japanese language: Hiragana and Katakana. The University of Michigan has a very valuable <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umichjlp/kana.html">resource to learn them</a>. I would advise you to write them often until you memorize them. Its a lot of work, but you can easily memorize 5-10 symbols each day. And after you learn hiragana, it will be much easier to start learning how the language works. I don't recommend you to learn japanese based on the western alphabet.<br /><br />After you learn hiragana you can start learning some conversation. And while nothing substitutes real classes (with a japanese teacher), <a href="http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/~ts/japanese/index.html">Teach yourself Japanese</a> is a nice place to start understanding the language. Another place to look for is the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese">Wikibooks</a>, but its still a lot incomplete.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

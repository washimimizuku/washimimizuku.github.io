title: Almost a photoblog
---

The english version of this blog is almost turning into a nature photoblog, I apologize for that. Looking at the last posts, most of them are of photos. Actually I do have a nature photoblog: <a href="http://fotosnatureza.blogs.sapo.pt/">Fotos da Natureza</a>.<br /><br />Soon I'll be paying more atention to the english version of the blog, specially in the church section, but I'm not ready to talk about that yet. Stay tunned :)

title: Conference t-shirts for women
---

Today <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/tech_tshirts_ar.html">I was remembered</a> about something I wanted to blog about for a long time.<br /><br />You know, women have different bodies than man have. Fortunately, I would say. And I would say they feel really discriminated when they go to a conference, and get a t-shirt made for a man. That's really sad. I hope my wife gets a nice female t-shirt when we go to the <a href="http://www.liftconference.com">Lift Conference</a> (this is not a critique to the Lift Conference, it's just an example since we are going there in February. This applies to all conferences that don't do t-shirts for women).<br /><br />Yes, it's just a t-shirt. But discrimination is in the sum of little things.

title: The Last Word And The Word After That by Brian McLaren
---

Just finished reading it. The Last Word And The Word After That is the last book on the A New Kind Of Christian triology. It is very similar to the others. The main theme this time is afterlife: What happens when we die? Not only that, but how the view we have of after life afects the rest of our theology.<br /><br />Good book, as the others. But the second one is the best.<br /><br />

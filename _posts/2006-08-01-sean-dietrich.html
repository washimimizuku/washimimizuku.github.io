Recently Sean commented in one of my posts and invited me to visit <a href="http://www.seandietrich.com/">his website</a>. He is a musician and he makes his songs available for free in his website. I have been listening to some of them, and from what I have heard so far, the music is great. I specially loved the Pharisee Song.<br /><br />So, go there, hear the music, and if you like it, consider a donation in the amount you feel it is worth.

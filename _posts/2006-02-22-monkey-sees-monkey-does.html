What do you do when you don't have any ideas left? You make a movie called <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/thewild/">The Wild</a> which is a copy of Madagascar, or a remake of <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/bambi2/index_flash.html">Bambi</a>. I'm waiting now for the Pinocchio 2 movie...<br />

I've just seen the <a href="http://www.joost.com/">future of TV</a>, and I like it. Now, if someone could just give me an invite, I would really appreciate it.<br /><br />How can I describe Joost? It's like having cable tv in your computer. But you can choose not only the channel, but also the show you want to watch. And at the same time you can chat with other people who are watching the show, use gtalk, and other nice features.<br /><br />For the technically inclined, it works like a peer to peer network. Which means the more people watching it, the better it gets. The weight of it is not only in the Joost servers, but distributed around the users. <br /><br />

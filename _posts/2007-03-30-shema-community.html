Recently I noticed <a href="http://shemacommunity.typepad.com/">Shema Community</a>, based in Geneva, Switzerland. Looks really interesting, worth a look if you are interested in the Emerging Church. A little about them:<br /><br /><i>"Shema Community Movement is not another ‘church’ or ’denomination’ within the Christian faith or religion but a ‘grass-roots’ missional movement (missional means leading a ‘go to them’ life, instead of a ‘come to us and become like us’ life), sharing the belief that ‘good news must be good news for everybody or it is not good news at all.’ At our core, we embrace Judeo-Christian essentials measuring ‘goodness’ by what we practice, who we’re becoming, what we embrace, what we create, and whom we include."</i>

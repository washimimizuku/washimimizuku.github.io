title: Treat him as you would a pagan
---

<i>"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, <b>treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector</b>."</i> (Matthew 18:15-17)<br /><br />What does this mean? Does it mean you should stop talking with that person? Does it mean you should use condemning language with that person? Insult that person?<br /><br />Well, that's not the way you deal with unbelievers, is it? So, I don't think that is what the text means. Instead of that, you should keep loving that person, maintain a relationship. Be salt and light in their life. Just has you would any other unbeliever. What do you think?

title: 'Lift 2007: First Impressions'
---

I'm at <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007/">Lift Conference</a> right now, and I'm having a great time. Some first impressions:<br /><br /><b>The Good</b><br /><br />- They have t-shirts for women! You may remember that is something I <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?cat=9&amp;id=871">blogged about</a>.<br />- Everything looks so nice and well organized.<br />- I love the fact that they didn't give me a huge bag filled with useless stuff. Just the t-shirt and a small (but really complete) information package.<br /><br /><b>The Bad</b><br /><br />- We were without wireless for a good part of the morning. Not a big problem, in my opinion. We actually got to pay atention to the conference and talk to each other.<br />- How come it's cold and it doesn't snow? I feel tricked... But that's not really Lift's fault :D

This book is exactly about that kind of simplicity in Christ-like movements expansion.<br /><br />For those that have read books from Neil Cole, Wolfgang Simson or Alan Hirsch, you won't find much new in this book in terms of principles. What you will find is a good simple and practical description of how those principles work in practice.<br /><br />I guess that's the main value of the book. Showing that the kingdom of God can grow in a simple way, through relationships of love. And showing how we so many times overcomplicate matters. And we overcomplicate because we want to remain in control, instead of trusting God, who really is in control.<br /><br />Honour God, Love Neighbor.

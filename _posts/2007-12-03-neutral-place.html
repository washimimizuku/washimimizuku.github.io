title: Neutral place
---

There is a very popular concept in both modern and post-modern churches called "neutral place". This is a concept coming from the seeker-sensitive movement, and the idea is that you should have meetings in a public neutral place, because unbelievers will feel more comfortable to go there then to go to a more personal space, like someone's house<br /><br />I think it is time for someone to say it. Neutral places are completely overrated. Looking back on my experience, neutral places were the second biggest simple community / house church killer I have ever seen, right after re-institutionalizing. More specifically, moving from a personal space to a "neutral" space is a church killer. It will destroy much of the personal touch in the community, and in the end, the community itself.<br /><br />The real question is that we move to "neutral" places because we are trying to evangelize people before we create relationships with them. We want them to come to the "neutral" place, and then we may want to create a relationship with them. But that's a much harder thing to happen than the opposite.<br /><br />So, why do we want to evangelize before creating relationships? For a number of different reasons. The most common is that we don't have time to create relationships because we are too busy "doing church" (will you have time to create relationships after?). another popular reason is that when you work full-time in ministry, you don't have non-christian friends to create relationships with. Or you are so christian that all your friends are christian. All of those are really lousy reasons.<br /><br />Are this words too harsh? Is your experience different than mine?

title: The Japanese Mind  by Roger Davies
---

This is a book about understanding the japanese culture. It is a compilation of several essays on different aspects of their culture, each chapter being a stand-alone text.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. It felt very accurate, and was a great way to learn different aspects of the japanese culture. And more than that, showed the difference between the japanese culture and the "ocidental culture" (which turns out to be USA culture). Even for me, a latin, that was a good way to better understand the culture.<br /><br />A great book to buy.

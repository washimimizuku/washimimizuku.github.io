title: Field reports
---

I'm giving up on making bird watching field reports in english. If you want to see them, you have to check the portuguese version. It doesn't make sense to me to have two copies of the same field report.<br /><br />Instead of field reports, what you'll find here is some bird descriptions, bird spots, and some interesting birding stuff I may stumble upon. Stuff that can be usefull to you if you plan a birding trip to Portugal. And I guarantee you, Portugal is a great place for that :)

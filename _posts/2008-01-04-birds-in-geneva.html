title: Birds in Geneva
---

One of the cool things of being in Geneva, is that there are excellent bird watching spots inside the city. Not only because 1/4 of the city is made of public parks, but because there is a lake and two rivers inside the city. I have seen already about 50 different species around Geneva, and there are still a lot more to be seen.<br /><br />My favourite 3 spots until now, are La Perl du Lac, Parc La Grange, and the spot where the two rivers meet. But I still have a lot to explore, so I bet I'll some other nice surprises.<br /><br />Here are some photos, but since I left my big gun in Portugal (the 300mm), all the photos are taken with the 50mm lens. I really miss my big lens :(<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/2131547100/" title="Corvos Marinhos e Gaivotas by Emerging Birder, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/2131547100_88d10b9490_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Corvos Marinhos e Gaivotas" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/2131546752/" title="Mergulhão de Crista (Podiceps cristatus) by Emerging Birder, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/2131546752_71ea322525_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Mergulhão de Crista (Podiceps cristatus)" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/2128826059/" title="Merganso-grande (Mergus merganser) - macho by Emerging Birder, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2164/2128826059_2361fe39b2_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Merganso-grande (Mergus merganser) - macho" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/2118173359/" title="Merganso-grande (Mergus merganser) - fêmea by Emerging Birder, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2378/2118173359_a019110651_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Merganso-grande (Mergus merganser) - fêmea" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/2096672437/" title="Guincho (Larus ridibundus) by Emerging Birder, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2143/2096672437_fb5eca57d9_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="Guincho (Larus ridibundus)" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/2096672169/" title="Guincho (Larus ridibundus) by Emerging Birder, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2200/2096672169_55af07649f_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="Guincho (Larus ridibundus)" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/2130769997/" title="Pisco de Peito Ruivo (Erithacus rubecula) by Emerging Birder, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2139/2130769997_58e13feaaa_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Pisco de Peito Ruivo (Erithacus rubecula)" /></a>

title: So You Want To Start A House Church? by Frank Viola
---

Sometimes you approach a book with certain expectations. That was the case with this book. After all the theory from the last 3 books, I was expecting this one to be an essencially practical book, but that is not the case.<br /><br />This book is mostly about the need we have today for the ministry of the apostle, and what's his place in church planting. Frank clearly explains the function of the apostle, the need of church planting, but what the book has in what to do, lacks in how to do it. You end the book thinking: "Well, great! And now what? How do we do that?"<br /><br />I am a little critical of lack of practical instructions and examples. I mean, I'm not into this church thing to discuss theoretically about stuff. I'm into this to make it happen. Sadly, I think that we talk, and talk, and talk, and... we keep talking! OK, enough rant.<br /><br />The book is actually good if you are searching for theory in new testament church planting. But that's it. If you are looking for something practical, look elsewhere. Maybe in the soon to be released <a href="http://www.ptmin.org/gathering.htm">Gathering in Homes</a>, by the same author. It looks like I was not the only one complaining...

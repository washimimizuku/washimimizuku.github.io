title: Website for bird observations
---

Lately I have been developing a idea for a website about bird watching. The purpose of the website is to record all the observations made by its users (species, photos, places), and by doing so to create a database for the localization of all the species.<br /><br />One of the important features will be geopositioning of the birds, so that I can draw maps with the birds locations. If many people use it, in one year it will be possible to see in detail where a certain species can be seen regularly, and its evolution thoughout the year. And all that easily seen in maps, graphs and tables.<br /><br />What do you think of this idea?

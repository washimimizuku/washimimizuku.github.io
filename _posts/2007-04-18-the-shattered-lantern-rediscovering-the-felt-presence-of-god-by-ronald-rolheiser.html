title: 'The Shattered Lantern: Rediscovering the Felt Presence of God by Ronald Rolheiser'
---

I feel like the modern church forgot a lot of what means to be contemplative. We are all about praying for objectives, achieving goal, and we end up forgetting that we need more quiet time, more contemplative times. We need to hear from God. And that's what this book is all about.<br /><br />The book starts by showing what is contemplation, and why we lost it: Narcissism, pragmatism, and unbridled restlessness. This is a very important part of the book, it's where we understand our sickness, where we understand what is wrong.<br /><br />After that it goes on describing three different contemplative traditions: Mystical, Protestant, and theistic. And by so doing, it gives us a nice idea of how contemplation works in practice, and the various facets it has.<br /><br />The last chapter ends the book in a perfect way, showing some practices necessary to restore our contemplative aspect. I could describe them here, but it wouldn't be the same as reading them after the rest of the book.<br /><br />I really loved the book, and I recommend it to every christian. It's a very practical book. And contemplation is something we really need to restore in the church of our days. A must read.

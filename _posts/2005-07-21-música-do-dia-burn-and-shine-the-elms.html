title: 'MÃºsica do Dia: Burn And Shine - The Elms'
---

Yeah, we're gonna burn, burn, burn.<br />And we're gonna shine, shine, shine.<br />Even if it wears us out, or takes<br />us out past these county lines.<br />We're sick of moving oh, so slow,<br />And being told where to go.<br />Making up our minds to burn and shine.<br /><br />One soul in a year ain't all that bad<br />When its the only chance you ever had.<br />Don't you ever wish for something true?<br />Something to pour your heart and soul into?<br /><br />Take all your feelings, and put 'em aside,<br />And get what matters on your mind!<br /><br />All you love will surely come and go,<br />And life is all your moments in a row.<br />No more crying for the days gone by.<br />And no one ever loses if they try!

title: Church is not about numbers
---

Simon writes a <a href="http://blog.simon-cozens.org//post/view/1046">nice critique</a> to the Church Growth Movement. Using the example of Yonago, a city in Japan, they go about saying how many churches are needed for the city to be blessed. As if 2 or 3 persons gathered together was not enough anymore. Anyway, how can they get to that number without the blessing of God? Weird people, talking about the church as if it was a production line.

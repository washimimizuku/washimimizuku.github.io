<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy">Taxonomy</a><b>*</b> is the science of classifying living things. The bird watcher registers his observations based on the taxonomy of bird species. That classification helps identifying the birds, through knowledge of the family of the bird, making the number os species to compare smaller.<br /><br />There are several websites that help us doing that. The reference I use the most is <a href="http://www.bsc-eoc.org/avibase/avibase.jsp?lang=EN&amp;pg=home">Avibase</a>, which has the taxonomic tree of birds, and gives the name of the birds in several languages, the world map of the localization of the species, and other interesting information. <br /><br />Another website I discovered recently is <a href="http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/ispecies/">iSpecies</a>, which is not only about birds, but about every animal species. It's a search engine that gives lots of interesting information about a certain specie, including photos.<br /><br />The best place to find bird photos of birds in the internet, in my opinion, is a flickr group named <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/birdguide/">Field Guide: Birds of the World</a>, where you can search for birds by scientific name.<br /><br />With no doubt, the internet helps a lot the study of birds.

title: Feelings and Intuitions
---

Yesterday, during a very nice time with <a href="http://www.joshuacase.net/">Joshua and Laura</a> (we have to do more of this), there were several nice "theological" conversations. One of those kept running in my mind after we left. That normally happens when I feel we didn't get to an answer in the subject. The theme was feelings and intuitions.<br /><br />I personally use my intuition whenever I have to decide something major in my life (and according to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0713997273">Blink</a>, there may be a logical reason for that after all). And that contrasts a lot with the way I do other decisions, which happens always in a very logical and thoughtful process.<br /><br />Joshua confronted me with a very good point: If we rule our lives by intuition, how can we be sure we will not choose always the easier / most comfortable way (as in the opposite for the <b>right</b> way). For example, I may not "feel like" helping a certain person, but I should. If I go with my "feelings", I will not do the right thing.<br /><br />After some thinking (which always happens when we try to verbalize the way we do things that are routine to us), I got to the conclusion that I separate my intuition from my feelings. For me, they are two different things. My intuition is checked by convictions of what I should be and do (love God, love everyone as myself, etc). My feelings are this ethereal thing that changes constantly with the mood. I can say that because when I choose something intuitively, I don't choose the easy way out, but something else based on my convictions. And in my opinion, that's the way it should be.<br /><br />So, next time you hear the famous phrase "I don't feel led to..." coming out of your mouth, ask yourself what kind of feeling is it :)<br /><br />I would really love to see comments with your opinion on the subject.

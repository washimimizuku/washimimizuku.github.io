title: The artistic side of the Message of Jesus
---

<i>Then Jesus went into the temple, threw out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold doves. He told them, “It is written, ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer,’ but you are turning it into a hideout for bandits!”</i> (Matthew 21:12-13)<br /><br />I think we fail many times to see the artistic in what Jesus did. He was at least a storyteller. Most of his teaching is in parables. But he certainly used many other forms of art. At this particular occasion, I believe there was a bit of drama involved. The overturning of the moneychangers' tables clearly made people pay attention to what Jesus was communicating.<br /><br />Storytelling and Acting (and other forms of art) are very useful ways of communicating the truth of the gospel. And if we have to overturn some tables to get the message across, maybe we should start doing it.

It was a time to get to know the house church movement in French speaking Switzerland, create many relationships, and talk a lot about ministerial gifts and how they can be used in house churches. Great discussions, lot's of prayer, sharing of experiences, and a great integration with the kids. <br /><br />For me it was also a great time of reviving dreams and being encouraged to continue on the vision God has been giving me. The revolution is happening, and it cant be stopped.<br /><br />More photos in the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/sets/72157607433979770/">Torgon 2008 flickr set</a>.

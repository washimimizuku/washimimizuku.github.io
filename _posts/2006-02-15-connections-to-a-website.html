title: Connections to a website
---

Someone with too much free time developed a java applet to <a href="http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html">show the websites related to a certain website</a>. It shows every website linked to our website, and the ones that are connected to those. All this based on Google. May be usefull to find new websites that might interest us, or just for fun.

title: Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition
---

If you want to learn how to use Linux, the <a href="http://www.chongluo.com/books/rute/">Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition</a> is THE source. I used it to learn linux a long time ago and I still use it as a reference sometimes.<br /><br />This book can be used as a tutorial for the newbie, or as a reference for the more advanced user. It covers evrything you really need to know about the system, and even goes into subjects like c programming, system administration, networks, mail servers, Apache web server, postgreSQL, samba, and many other things. And its free! What more can you ask?

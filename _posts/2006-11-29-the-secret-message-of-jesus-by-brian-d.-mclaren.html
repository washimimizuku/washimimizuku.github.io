title: The Secret Message of Jesus by Brian D. McLaren
---

The Kingdom of God, what is it? For me, this is a question of utmost importance. I believe the meaning of the kingdom of God has been neglected throughout the history of the church. Try asking your christian friends what is it, and you'll be amazed with the answers (or lack of). That is the question this book tries to answer. And I have to say that it answers the question very well.<br /><br />This is a great book. Very well written, it is easy to read and yet deep enough in meaning. I like books like that. Books that talk about profound stuff in a simple and easy to understand way. There's a lot to learn from it, a lot to be practised, a lot to be debated.<br /><br />I even recommend it to unbelievers. It's a great introduction to Christianity. And in a sense, the answer to life, the universe, and everything (which, by the way, it's not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything">42</a>).

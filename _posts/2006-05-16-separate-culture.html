title: Separate culture
---

It's a sad fact that when someone becomes a christian, there is a process of changing his culture. And I am not talking of those few things that have to be changed because they go against the will of God. I'm talking about everything: The way you dress, speak, the kind of music, the activities, even holidays.<br /><br />For example, here in Portugal, the music we use in church has no portuguese influence. They are the same used in USA, but translated. I guess this happens all over the world. Another example is mother's day. In Portugal it is celebrated in a certain day. But evangelicals, because of missionary influence, celebrate the mother's day in a different day. I could go on and on.<br /><br />This may seem to small to be important, but the fact is that portuguese christians get to a point where they are no longer portuguese, but a mixture of portuguese with the traditions of the countries where the missionaries come from. That wouldn't be very bad, if it wasn't for the fact that they don't know how to relate to portuguese anymore. And how can we reach the ones we don't understand? It also makes the jump from non-christian to christian more difficult. People not only have to embrace Christ, but also this new christianized culture.<br /><br />We need to be very carefull not to "colonize" countries when we go there as missionaries. We are not here to convert the culture. We are here to help people get closer to God, expand the kingdom of God, reach the oppressed and marginalized. We are here to love.

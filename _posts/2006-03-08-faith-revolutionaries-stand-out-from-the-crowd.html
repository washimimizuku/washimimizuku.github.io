title: Faith Revolutionaries Stand Out From the Crowd
---

In a study about <a href="http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&amp;BarnaUpdateID=221">the difference between revolutionary born-again christians (aka emerging) and non-revolutionary ones</a> by the Barna Group, we find very interesting information.<br /><br />Emerging churcher are often acused of not believing in the bible in a serious way, but according to this study, the opposite is true:<br /><br /><i>"Almost two out of every three revolutionaries (64%) study the Bible every day. That’s close to three times the percentage of non-revolutionary born again adults who do so (23%)."</i><br /><br /><i>"Almost all revolutionaries (97%) strongly affirm “the Bible is totally accurate in all of the principles it teaches.” Far fewer non-revolutionary born again adults (65%) join them in that perspective."</i><br /><br />Another thing people use often to defend the institutional church, is that the worship time is much better (better music and stuff), and that you feel the presence of God much better. Well, not according to this study:<br /><br /><i>"About six out of every ten revolutionaries (57%) experience “intimate, personally stirring worship of God” on a daily basis. The same held true for only four out of every ten non-revolutionary born again adults (39%)."</i><br /><br />(Thanks to <a href="http://krusekronicle.typepad.com/kruse_kronicle/2006/03/faith_revolutio.html">Michael</a> for the link)

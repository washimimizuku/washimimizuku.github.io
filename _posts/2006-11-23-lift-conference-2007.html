title: Lift Conference 2007
---

The <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007/index.php">Lift Conference</a> will happen in 7-8-9 February, in Geneva, Switzerland, and I'll be there. I'm really looking forward for it, for several reasons.<br /><br />For starts, it's a grassroots conference. And I totally support grassroots conferences for several ideological reasons. It's also all about new stuff, vision, and innovation. The kind of things that makes us think outside the box. And it's also an excellent opportunity to meet other people, and actually engage in conversations with them.<br /><br />It will also be the first time I'll be in Switzerland, so it will be an excellent opportunity to do some tourism (I'll stay there for the following weekend). I also expect to do some (very light) birding, I'll probably see some swans and goose. It would be nice to get in touch with the emerging church in Geneva, but I don't know where to start.<br /><br />All in all, I think I'll have a great time there.

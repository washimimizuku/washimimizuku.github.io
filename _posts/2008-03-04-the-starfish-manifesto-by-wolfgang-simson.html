title: The Starfish Manifesto by Wolfgang Simson
---

Let me start by saying that <a href="http://elling.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/starfishmanifesto08.pdf">The Starfish Manifesto</a> (press the link to download it) is not really a book. It's more like a draft of a book, with many parts that would (and probably should) be changed and cut before becoming a book. Which means it is not easy to read, and it is really long. Only the really interested soul will be able to finish it (like I did, and no one else I know was able to).<br /><br />The Starfish Manifesto starts where <a href="http://www.simplice.net/artigo.php?cat=7&amp;id=950">Houses that Change the World</a> stopped. It is focused mainly on the prophetic and apostolic gifts, and how the strategy of God to the discipling of the planet can operate through those gifts.<br /><br />The book starts describing the roles of the prophet and of the apostle, and then how those roles work together for the envisioning of the strategy of the church, locally as well as globally. It finishes with some practical wisdom in how to make the jump. I identified a lot with what is written in the book, except with the financial principles.<br /><br />This book, together with <a href="http://www.simplice.net/artigo.php?cat=&amp;id=1059">The Forgotten Ways</a>, are at the moment, in my opinion, the ones that best describe the vision of God for the church of today. A organic, Christ-centered, Kingdom of God oriented, apostolic, missiological church.

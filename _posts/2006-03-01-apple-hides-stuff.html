title: Apple hides stuff
---

One thing I don't like about Apple, is that Apple hides stuff. No, I'm not talking about hiding what products are going to be released. What I'm talking about is when the hardware permits a certain functionality, and Apple takes that off using software.<br /><br />I have a iBook G4, one of the firsts. The graphic card has dual screen capabilities, and a wide range of resolutions. But Apple decided that an iBook couldn't have it, so it turns it off in firmware. Luckily we have <a href="http://www.rutemoeller.com/mp/ibook/ibook_e.html">Screen Spanning Doctor</a> to the rescue, which turns it on as it should be.<br /><br />Yesterday they launched the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> with the Intel processor. In the middle of all the features, now it has a onboard  graphics processor that uses the system RAM. OK, a marketing decision, I can live with that. But why would they force the ram used to be 64Mb when the onboard <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/">Intel GMA950</a> could use a maximum of 224Mb? OK, I agree this is not a very important thing. Not like the iBook one is. But the principle is the same.

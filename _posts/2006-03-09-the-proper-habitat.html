title: The proper habitat
---

<i>"(...) it goes without saying that real equipping is never produced by preaching 45-minute sermons every Sunday! Listening to sermons while frozen in pews fosters a muted priesthood. It does not produce spiritulal growth."</i> (Frank Viola em Who Is Your Covering?, p.116)<br /><br />We abuse the preaching model. It became a tool that's used for everything. I do believe there is room for preaching, specially in conferences, or other periodic gatherings. But if we really want to equip the saints, we have to use other methods. And no, bible schools, while valid, are not the rigth tool for all equipping either.<br /><br />What believers need is an habitat where they can learn and practice. A place where they grow inside a net of relationships, share experiences, have opportunities to minister to while also being ministered too. It seems to me that the proper habitat for that to happen is the house church / cell group /small group (wahtever you wish to call it). It's there that the relationship and intimacy can grow to the point where everyone ministers to everyone, and where the saints have opportunity to learn and practice the life of Christ.

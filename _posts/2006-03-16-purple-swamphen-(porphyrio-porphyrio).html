It's also a nice example of species recovery. Some years ago there were only a few of them in Portugal, and only one known breeding place, in Ludo, Ria Formosa. But now, this bird has extended his territory a lot. For example, it's really easy to see them in Lagoa de Albufeira, 300 km northwest of the Ria Formosa.<br /><br />The best place to see them is Quinta do Lago, in the west end of Ria Formosa. There is a artificial lake there created for a golf course, where the Purple Swamphen (and many other interesting birds) can be seen easily. It's an interesting thought: tourism not only getting along with nature, but actually helping it creating habitats. An example to be followed.

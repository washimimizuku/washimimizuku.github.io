title: Money strings
---

In danger of this becoming a blog pointing to Bob's articles, I would like to like to one more excelent article in his blog about <a href="http://bobhyatt.typepad.com/bobblog/2006/03/sane_planting_p.html">the money in church planting</a>. Here he talks about the economics involved in church planting.<br /><br />Due to my recent experiences, I have a strong feeling about this. I prefer to talk more about the subject in a later time, when things calm down, but I am very critic of the missionary system we have today. I'm not talking about the missionaries. I'm talking about the mission agencies that send them. The thing is, we (the locals) are the ones that clean the room and pick up the pieces in the end. And the root of the problem is normally the money, and the string it has attached.<br /><br />That's all I'm going to say for now.

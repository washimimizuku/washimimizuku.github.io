title: Where is my heart?
---

<i>"If this [points to heart] is empty, this [points to head] doesn't matter."</i> (Dicky Fox in Jerry Maguire)<br /><br />Lately I have been thinking a lot about this, specially concerning my job. Where is it that my heart is not empty? Where is my heart? What do I love to do? Because if I am not doing what I love to do, it doesn't matter how much effort I put on it, it will never be the best.<br /><br />When you do what you love, everything is different. Because you love it, you'll be more creative, you'll identify with it, and you will do a much better job with less effort. With less effort because it will be easy for you to do what you love, it will be less tiring.<br /><br />One of the most important things in job satisfaction, is for you to know what you love, and do everything you can to find a job in that area. The rest, is absolute nonsense, and the reason for many breakdowns, depressions, and unhappiness. And it's never too late to change...

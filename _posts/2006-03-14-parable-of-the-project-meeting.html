title: Parable of the project meeting
---

In a certain community, there was a meeting. In that meeting, the leader presented, for the first time, a completely organized project, with everything studied in detail. Not only that, but some steps had allready been made to start it. In the end, after explaining all the complexity of the project and all the reasons for the project to be done, he asked: "Do you agree with this? Do you have any suggestions?" And the people, seeing that everything was already planned, said nothing.<br /><br />Later, when the leader needed people to get involved in the project, to make it happen, no one was interested, because they didn't feel part of the planning process. So, in the end, the project died, with no one to carry it out.<br /><br />Another community got together to make a project. Since the beginning, everyone gave their ideas and opinions on what and how it would be done, and everything was considered and debated. After much time, it was finally decided how the project would be done. And many of the people that got involved in the planning process, got involved in the execution of the project, and there was much fruit.

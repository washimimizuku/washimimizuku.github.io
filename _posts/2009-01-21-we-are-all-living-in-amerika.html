title: We are all living in Amerika

<img src="/images/amerika.gif" /><br /><br />Looking at TV and newspapers lately, it seems Obama is everywhere. Some people have even been more interested in the USA elections than any other national subject around Europe. It shows that the american identity is stronger than ever. And it's like the media is accepting / pushing on us that we all depend on America. It made me remember "Amerika", the music from Rammstein: We are all living in Amerika. <br /><br /><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4w9EksAo5hY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4w9EksAo5hY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed><br /><br />I have no special opinion on Obama himself. Some affirm he is some kind of messiah, others believe he is the Antichrist. I think he is just someone charismatic with interesting ideas. It's more the fuss around it, specially outside America, that kind of worries me.

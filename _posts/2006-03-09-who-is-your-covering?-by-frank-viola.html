title: Who Is Your Covering? by Frank Viola
---

Leadership in the church is a touchy subject because there is a huge legacy from centuries of existence. Not only that, but many families depend on the income it brings. Some people have been pastors for all their life, and that's all they know how to do. If they lost their jobs, what would be of their families? Both things conspire to maintain things the way they are. That's why it is impossible for this book not to be polemic, since it shows us an alternative way of leadership.<br /><br />Frank, in this book, starts by showing you the way the early church lived leadership, authority and accountability. He doesn't go around the bush, e doesn't start with a big introduction to the subject, he goes right into it. And it gets messy right from the start. Not because he doesn't do it with love and the right atitude, but because it's impossible to go against the <i>status quo</i> without messing with something, being tradition the number one target.<br /><br />After you feel messed pretty good, he starts a defence of his position against the most common objections. This ends up being the most enlightening part of the book, giving you room for breathing, while answering some of your questions.<br /><br />When the shock is over he goes on explaining in a deeper way all the concepts he introduced, speaking of authority, submission, covering and apostles. And he finally wraps it up with some practical steps on what you can do.<br /><br />I'm going to spoil the effect and say what was the result of me reading this book. The first thing was that I couldn't even remember why I believed it the traditional way before. I mean, I am a christian for 13 years, I went to bible school, I was part of the church leadership for a long time in the past. The only thing I can say is: I was blind and now I see! Not completely blind, but I was needing glasses seriously. The other thing is I now begin to understand what mutual subjection is all about, and what authority really is. Now I think I really understand what it means to <i>“Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.”</i> (Ephesians 5:21)<br /><br />In the last review, I said the question was: Are you ready for it? Well, the question for this book is: Do you think you can handle the truth? Because there is no turning back...

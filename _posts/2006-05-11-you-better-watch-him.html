title: You better watch him
---

"I have been doing an analogy in Cats, and a person that will lie to the people, and the people will love him, and he leads the people in the wrong direction knowing he's lying to them, is a dangerous man. And you better watch him, because you might have to kill that nigga." (From the intro of Save, by Kleptones)<br /><br />Let's forget the racial and violent expression in the end for a moment. I don't want to kill anyone, and I believe in respecting every ethnic group. But this phrase, in the words of the street, tells a lot about what real leadership is all about, and how to deal with dangerous leaders. I mean, no one here wants to kill bad leaders, but we better watch them, because we may have to put a stop to their actions.<br /><br />I was planning to write a lot more about this, but I feel like meditating in this is strong enough. Have your own conclusions, and comment about them if you want.

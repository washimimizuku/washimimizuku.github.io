title: A new kind of leader
---

There's a blog I really love called <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a>. It's mostly a blog about user experience in computer stuff, but Kathy talks about many principles that can be applied everywhere in life. Today she posted an article called <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/03/manager_20.html">Manager 2.0</a> where she talks a little bit about the role of a leader as it should be today. She made a very interesting table comparing the old way (bossy) and the new way (community oriented):<br /><br /><img src="http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/manager2_0.jpg" /><br /><br />I would just change "A Hollywood Model" into "Organical Structure", which I think shows better the meaning. But the rest is excelent, as usual. Lots of principles that can be applied to the business environment, but some of them also to any community, like for example the church. Just change the word employee for member or brother, and you'll see Church 2.0 kind of leadership (and also Church 0.0 kind of church too, since it was like that in the beginning).

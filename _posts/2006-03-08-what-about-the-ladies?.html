title: What about the ladies?
---

Today is the international women's day, or something like that. So, it's not my day. Big deal. I mean, I respect women. I don't help my wife at home, I <b>share</b> everything with her. I cook, iron, wash clothes, wash dishes, all that stuff. The only thing I don't do is clean the house, and that's because we both agree I clean like crap. I challenge anyone to say the house is cleaner after I clean it. But I do other stuff while she cleans it. And no, I'm not talking about watching tv kind of stuff. OK. So... big deal, right? Nothing to brag about, really. It's not like I do more than she does.<br /><br />But you know, IWD is not about sharing shores with your wife, right? Or even love and respect her the way she deserves. It is (I think) about women getting the same respect men do. Not my wife, but women all over the world. Or at least in church. Maybe we could start there?<br /><br />My point is, what's the name of that respectable theologian <b>woman</b> that has published many books? There aren't many, are there? And can we honestly say that we respect both women an men the same way when they speak?<br /><br />What that means for me is that in respecting women, we (the church. well, at least some) talk the talk, but we don't walk the walk. It's time to give them proper respect.

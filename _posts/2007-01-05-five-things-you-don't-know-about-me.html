title: Five things you don't know about me
---

André had the bad idea of <a href="http://blog.delaranja.com/?p=799">tagging me</a>, so here it goes:<br /><br />1. <b>I don't like being tagged</b>. Maybe because I made my life very public in the internet already, so there is not much to tell about me. That's why it was a bad idea. I never know what to write...<br /><br />2. Though I hate being tagged, <b>I can't resist responding</b>. Which makes me hate being tagged even more.<br /><br />3. <b>I was a nationalist</b>, but not any more (sometimes it's ugly face shows up, but I fight it off). And when I say nationalist, I mean the kind that has a 2 meter flag on top of the bed, that gets offended when you don't know how to sing the Portuguese national anthem (it's "egrégios", stupid!), and that would be really aggressive against foreign people immigrating to Portugal. I still get an itch when people talk bad about Portugal, but that's it.<br /><br />4. <b>I have a problem with heights</b>. It's not really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia">Acrophobia</a>, since I don't get scared, but I lose balance, and tend to lean forward. And here's the catch: If there is an obstacle waist high between me and the abyss, I don't lose balance. Weird.<br /><br />5. <b>I am the person with the worst memory in the world</b>. Just ask my wife, she'll say it's true. It's probably my worst defect. I like to think that it's because I'm a genius, but that's not true...<br /><br />Ok, that's it. And no, I won't be tagging anyone. That's something else I don't like to do.

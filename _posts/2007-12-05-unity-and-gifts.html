title: Unity and Gifts
---

Have you ever noticed that in the Bible Unity and Gifts are themes that go together many times? For example, you can see that in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:1-16">Ephesians 4:1-16</a> and in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012">1 Corinthians 12</a>. Is it a coincidence?<br /><br />I don't think so. The fact is that people with different gifts tend to push an agenda that has everything to do with their gift. A pastor will push the church to be a caring community, neglecting other areas. A evangelist will push it to be a missional one. And so on. And if we are not careful with that, we will sacrifice unity in the process, because people with different gifting will feel displaced (not to mention that the community will be seriously handicapped). Conflict will arise, churches will split, and new denominations will be born.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with emphasizing our area of ministry. But as members of a local and global community, we have to be sensitive to the fact that there is no single gift that is more important than the others. In love and humility, we need to recognize the advantages of the gifts other people have, and what is lacking in our own gifts. This way we will learn to respect every person no matter what their gift, maintain a spirit of unity in the body of Christ, and have well balanced communities.

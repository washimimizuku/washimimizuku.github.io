title: Words of the tired ones
---

Words of the tired ones, of the ones that stayed after everyone left, of the ones that didn't give up:<br /><br /><i>"You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve. Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."</i> (John 6:67-69)<br /><br />It is hard to stay steadfast even though we don't see anything happen. It is hard to continue when we see so many people around us giving up, and the days become months and years. But blessed are the ones that keep going, for they will see the glory of God.

title: On blogging frequently
---

Eric Kintz wrote an interesting article last month called <a href="http://blog.marketingprofs.com/2006/06/w_why_blog_post_frequency_does.html">"Why Blog Post Frequency Does Not Matter Anymore"</a> which I found really interesting. He makes the following points, some of which I will comment:<br /><br /><b>1. Traffic is generated by participating in the community; not daily posting</b><br /><br />This is so true. People will visit your blog because they create a relationship with you. Because they are your friends, or because you interact with each other in some way. They will visit also if you are some kind of guru, but there aren't much gurus: that's why they are gurus in the first place.<br /><br /><b>2. Traffic is irrelevant to your blogâ€™s success anyway</b><br /><b>3. Loyal readers coming back daily to check your posts is so Web 1.0</b><br /><b>4. Frequent posting is actually starting to have a negative impact on loyalty</b><br /><br />Probably. Recently I took some blogs out of my rss feed list because there were too much articles to read. I ended up cutting people that I had no relationship with, people that posted too frequently (because many times those posts are uninteresting), and people that posted huge articles.<br /><br /><b>5. Frequent posting keeps key senior executives and thought leaders out of the blogosphere</b> <br /><b>6. Frequent posting drives poor content quality</b><br /><br />This actually depends. If frequent posting makes you write posts just because you have to, then yes, that's true. But there are some people that have several interesting things to write about every day.<br /><br /><b>7. Frequent posting threatens the credibility of the blogosphere </b><br /><b>8. Frequent posting will push corporate bloggers into the hands of PR agencies </b><br /><b>9. Frequent posting creates the equivalent of a blogging landfill </b><br /><b>10. I love my family too much</b><br /><br />And I do too. That's why I did the cutings on the feeds I read. I ended up spending too much time reading blogs, time that I could be using with my family, or interacting with other bloggers.

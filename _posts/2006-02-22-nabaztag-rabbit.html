The <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/vl/FR/index.jsp">Nabaztag Rabbit</a> is a "personal companion" with built-in WiFi. It interacts with you, receives messages for you, tells you about the weather, stock market, traffic and all sort of stuff.<br /><br />People don't know what else to invent. And what's worse, why do I feel an urge to buy something so useless? Go figure...

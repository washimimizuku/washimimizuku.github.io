<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbarreto/118745996/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/118745996_cde0bc051c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" align="right" alt="Common Blue (Polyommatus icarus)" /></a>I just found this very interesting article called <a href="http://www.emergingchurch.info/reflection/eruvandi/index.htm">Feminine Voice</a>:<br /><br /><i>"We must begin to forge church that is both masculine and feminine, where men can lead in male ways, and women can lead in female ways. Where we understand the notion of ‘headship’ to belong to Christ alone. Where women know their own sinfulness doesn’t reside in their abilities to teach and enable growth in other believers, and where they rightly reject the guilt imposed upon them about these giftings."</i><br /><br />How do we do this?

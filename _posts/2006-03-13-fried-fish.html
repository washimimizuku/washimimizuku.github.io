title: Fried fish
---

This is a story I heard some time ago. It goes something like this:<br /><br />A man that really liked fried fish, was invited by a friend to try this new recipe he had found. He tried the fish, and it was actually the best fried fish he ever had in his whole life. So, his friend handed him the recipe, and he found something curious. For some reason, in the recipe it said to take of the head and the tail from the fish! Strange, he thought. And when he asked why to his friend, he didn't know why.<br /><br />So, this man, who was really curious, asked him who gave him the recipe, and went to meet that person to make the same question. And that person didn't know either. But, being a persistent man, he kept searching for the answer, from person to person, until he finally got to the person who invented the recipe, a really eldery woman.<br /><br />Filled with enthusiasm, knowing he would finally know the answer, he asked her: "Dear lady, why do you cut off the head and the tail from the fish?" To which she replied: "That's because my pan is very small, and the fish wouldn't fit there whole."<br /><br />It's time to start inquiring about our traditions. The book "Pagan Christianity" by Frank Viola is a good place to start.

title: Focus on the path
---

<i>"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."</i> (Galatians 6:9)<br /><br />We don't like this. What we really like is fast results. We want to travel fast, eat fast, talk fast, fast everything. Not becoming weary takes too long.<br /><br />What we don't realize many times is that the path we take is more important than the place we get too. Jesus never asked the disciples to focus on results, but on paths. He showed the disciples what to do and how to do it. Go into all the world and do this and that until he returns. What is the target? Spread the kingdom of God. Who is responsible for the results? The Holy Spirit will convict people. And if we keep doing stuff the right way, results will come.<br /><br />Why do we focus so much in results? Numbers, numbers. Where do they come from? That is the corporate world way of doing stuff. We try something for 6 months, if we don't get the results (profit), we change the way we do it, until we get the results. If we go along this road, soon we'll start thinking that results are more important than the path, then we start changing the interpretation of the Bible, and finally we end up thinking the ends justify the means. We start searching for the leaders that achieve results, instead of the ones that walk the Walk. And what is the result? A "church" that resembles more a company than a family, that doesn't really care about the unmeasurable quality but only about the measurable numbers.<br /><br />Are we there yet? Maybe we are...

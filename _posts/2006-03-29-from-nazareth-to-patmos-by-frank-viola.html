title: From Nazareth To Patmos by Frank Viola
---

The objective of this book is to tell the story of the new testament in a chronological way, showing how the kingdom of God spread in the early church.<br /><br />Well, I think there's not much to see in this book. It doesn't go deep enough in anything, and there are plenty of other books that go much deeper in this subject and in a much better way.<br /><br />So, this book is really a waste of money, in my opinion. Anyone wants to buy mine?

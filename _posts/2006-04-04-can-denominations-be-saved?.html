title: Can denominations be saved?
---

An excelent discussion to follow <a href="http://odyssey.blogs.com/odyssey/2006/03/can_the_denomin.html">here</a> and <a href="http://odyssey.blogs.com/odyssey/2006/03/if_not_denomina.html">here</a>.<br /><br />There is a part of me that says: "Die, denominations, die!!!", since the denominationalism is seen by me like one of the major hindrances to the unity of the body. But on the other hand, it's not enough to get rid of it. What are we going to create to substitute it?<br /><br />And that's what I want to see the emerging movement do: Create. We have criticized enough, it's time to really invest in creating a viable alternative. And yes, many are allready doing it. In the end, it's all a process that takes time.

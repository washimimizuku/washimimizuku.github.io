title: Houses That Change the World by Wolfgang Simson
---

I am a big supporter of the house church movement. I support it, I advocate it, and I live it. So, for me, this book didn't bring much new, it was more a question of hearing someone describing part of what I'm living. But for someone that is not in it, this is an excellent book to read. It gives you the reasons for why we believe we have to return to the house church model of church.<br /><br />On the other hand, in my opinion, Simson's opinion is too strict for my taste. Specially concerning his view of the "fivefold" ministry and the way he believes house church is the only way to go. God can move in many different ways. I also dislike the way he uses numbers to show that the house church is the right thing to do. The reasons have to be more profound than that. But well, that's the problem with books. If I was talking with him face to face, maybe we would end up realizing we think the same way. Books don't give much room for dialogue.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone frustrated with the institutional church, and that wants to learn more about other ways of being church. This is a great book to give you a general idea of what the house church movement is.

<i>"Procrastinate: to drag one’s ass in such a pathetic manner as to ensure one’s place in life as a loser."</i> (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Song_for_Bobby_Long">A Love Song for Bobby Long</a>)<br /><br /><i>"For what it’s worth: it’s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of. If you find that you’re not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again."</i> (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curious_Case_of_Benjamin_Button_(film)">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a>)

A good thing about the blogging world is that you get to know people similar to you, that you want to meet in real life.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rmcrob.com/">Randy McRoberts</a> is such a person to me. He is an emerging computer geek, just like I am. And he likes cooking! That's another of my pleasures. Maybe I'll had a cooking category soon.<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.simon-cozens.org/">Simon Cozens</a> is another uber-geek, a very well known Perl programmer, who gave up his former life to go to Japan as a missionary. Not only that, but he also leans to the emerging view of christianity.<br /><br /><a href="http://nanolog.blogspot.com">Headphonaught</a> is another japan-loving emergent geek . And he shares my passion for Sushi and for Apple (the company)! Who would say there are so many like-minded in the emergent world?<br /><br />Finnaly, what was missing? Another emerging birder like me! That's the case of <a href="http://www.gardenofrenown.blogspot.com/">Dave</a>, and I bet there are a few more. If you come to Portugal, I'll show you the best bird spots :)<br /><br />I wonder if there are more like-minded people in the world...

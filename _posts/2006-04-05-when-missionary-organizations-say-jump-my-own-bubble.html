title: 'When missionary organizations say jump: My own bubble'
---

I have allready talked about the problem missionaries have in creating relationships. It happens mostly because they are not in the same places "normal people" are. They don't have a job, neither they have other easy way of meeting people.<br /><br />To make matters worse, many of them create a different habitat for their own families. They hang out with other missionaries, they create special schools for their children, and in the end, they end up creating a habitat that looks like home.<br /><br />The trap is easy to fall in. Missionaries need to be with other missionaries to share experiences, take a break from "the work". And without noticing it, they start creating their own neat world, like a bubble inside an hostile environment.  The trap is in this: A truth that is streached until it becomes a lie. Missionaries do need to be with other people that are having the same struggles they are, but not to the point where they create a separate world just for them. Not to the point where they start seeing other missionaries as their community.<br /><br />Have relationships with other missionaries, but beware of separating yourself from the real world. After all, that's the world you are trying to reach.

title: Beating a Dead Horse
---

Dakota tribal wisdom says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount. However, in business we often try other strategies with dead horses, including the following: <br /><br />1. Buying a stronger whip.<br />2. Changing riders.<br />3. Say things like, "This is the way we have always ridden this horse."<br />4. Appointing a committee to study the horse.<br />5. Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.<br />6. Increasing the standards to ride dead horses.<br />7. Appointing a tiger team to revive the dead horse.<br />8. Creating a training session to increase our riding ability.<br />9. Comparing the state of dead horses in todays environment.<br />10. Change the requirements declaring that "This horse is not dead."<br />11. Hire contractors to ride the dead horse.<br />12. Harnessing several dead horses together for increased speed.<br />13. Declaring that "No horse is too dead to beat."<br />14. Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.<br />15. Do a Cost Analysis study to see if contractors can ride it cheaper.<br />16. Purchase a product to make dead horses run faster.<br />17. Declare the horse is "better, faster and cheaper" dead.<br />18. Form a quality circle to find uses for dead horses.<br />19. Revisit the performance requirements for horses.<br />20. Say this horse was procured with cost as an independent variable.<br />21. Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.<br /><br />(taken from <a href="http://www.thehumorarchives.com/joke/Beating_a_Dead_Horse">here</a>)

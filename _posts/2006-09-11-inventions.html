Two unrelated ideas I had this holidays which I am too lazy to work on:<br /><br /><b>Focused metering</b><br /><br />This is a new functionality I would like to see in cameras. It would work the same way as spot metering, but the metering would be based in all the focused area in the picture.<br /><br /><b>Tan-through bikinis</b><br /><br />Well, that was actually a nice idea too, but someone <a href="http://www.tanthrough.com/">allready did that</a>.

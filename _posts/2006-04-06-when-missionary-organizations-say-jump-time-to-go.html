title: 'When missionary organizations say jump: Time to go'
---

To end this interesting and grumpy series, I would like to speak about what should happen when everything works:<br /><br />Joe gets vision, language knowledge, a correct basic understanding of the culture, spiritual preparation (some bible school may be part of it), financial support with no strings attached, and he goes to the place God showed him. When he gets there, he starts investing in people, being salt and light, creating relationships, integrating in culture, helping people in a genuine way. People start to embrace the kingdom of God, and a church is born.<br /><br />The church grows (I'm not talking about numbers here), and becomes a real family, with everyone learning to follow Jesus in everyday life, discovering their gifts, practicing their gifts, ministering to each other. A real new testament kind of church. And then, the missionary becomes the full-time pastor of this church and creates a leadership to minister to the laity...<br /><br />Well, if this was a podcast (audio article), in that last phrase you would listen to the vinil scratching. Wait a minute! The missionary becomes the leader? Creates a distinction between clergy and laity? The clergy ministers to people while they sit on their pews? Not in my Bible! And I would love to see anyone showing this happening in the new testament! Go ahead, give it a try.<br /><br />When the church is planted, dear church planter, it's time to move on. It's time for that community to rise up and start walking on their own. If you did a fine job, the church will be just fine. A nice leadership will rise within the church, and they will be able to stand on it's own (keeping relationships with other churches, of course). If you fail to do so, even if you teached everyone to be a minister, they will see you as the special one, the leader above them. And that place belongs to Christ.<br /><br />Do you want to know what happens to churches where the church planters stay as pastors? The church planter is seen as someone above, and people fail to minister one to another, they become dependent. That church will never be able to stand on its own, and they will have a crisis when the church planter retires/dies. Some people even call this kind of church planting <a href="http://blog.simon-cozens.org/post/view/1070">colonialism</a>.<br /><br />Do the work, and then leave in proper time. That's the best gift you'll ever give them. One day, it will be time to go.

title: A community should be empowering
---

I believe God has a purpose on the creation of this world. Let's call it the Ultimate Purpose. I also believe that in order to achieve it, God has a purpose for every person in his Kingdom. And that for each person to be able to fulfil his/her purpose, he has given abilities, some natural, some supernatural. And also that that purpose is in line with the ultimate purpose of God.<br /><br />But for that purpose to be fulfilled, it is not enough for each person to have his/her own individual purposes. It seems God has made things in such a way that people can't really fulfil their purposes all by themselves. They have to find a community, and synergize their abilities to really be able to fulfil the ultimate purpose.<br /><br />Because of all that, one of the most important roles of a christian community, is for us to empower each other on our callings. And this can happen in very different ways: incentivating, contributing with our money and with our time, counselling, pray, share experiences, help founding out creative new ways to fulfil it, etc.<br /><br />This has everything to do with what I wrote earlier about <a href="http://www.simplice.net/en/artigo.php?id=1100">Unity and the Gifts</a>, but goes further in saying that we are not only to respect other giftings for the sake of unity, but we are also to get involved in the working of the gifts of the members of our community. Give them all the help they need to fulfil their purposes. In the end, their purposes are our purposes too.

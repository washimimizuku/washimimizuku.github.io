title: The rethinking process
---

Today I was talking with some new friends that are going through the rethinking process inside the church. They want a transparent non institutional church. They want a truer church. I share their enthusiasm, and cheer them to go deeper in their relationship with God, and I am happy that they are doing that.<br /><br />But I also feel sorry for them. Sorry because I know what I have been trough, I know the price I had to pay (and still do), I know all about the rejection, the accusation, the persecution, the humiliation. I know all about being pressured by friends and family to "return to the truth". I know all about being abandoned by brothers and sisters. I have paid the price, and so will they.<br /><br />I always tell them what the future has for them. I always tell them how much it will cost. But somehow, it seems they don't quite believe it. Maybe that's for the better, maybe if they really new the price, they would be discouraged from the start...

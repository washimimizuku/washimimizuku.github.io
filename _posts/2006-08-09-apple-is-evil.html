title: Apple is evil
---

I'm starting to believe that Apple is evil.<br /><br />We all remember when Apple released Tiger (aka Mac OS X 10.4) with Dashboard, which was a Konfabulator (now <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">yahoo widgets</a>) rip-off. That gave a sore taste to many. Why? Basically, the idea was ripped-of from the Konfabulator guys, without giving them any credit, and instantly killing the need for Konfabulator. Not only that, but many developers started to think this way: "Why will I develop my inovating products for Apple, if later there is the chance of them being ripped-of?"<br /><br />To make matters worst, Apple launched iWeb, a rip-off of <a href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/">Sandvox</a>. Tough luck for the Karelia guy, since he had been ripped off with <a href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/small_and_nimble_the_long_s.html">Watson</a> too. But while they were both rip-offs, there was still room for Watson and Sandvox, so not all is lost for Karelia.<br /><br />And this week, to show everyone that that's the way it works, the new Mac OS X, nicknamed Leopard, has a panoplia of ripped-off apps. Just take a look at <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2006/08/08/apples-research-rip-off-department/">"Apple’s Research & Rip-off department"</a> and <a href="http://phillryu.com/2006/08/08/7-apps-on-leopards-hit-list/">"7 Apps on Leopard’s Hit List"</a> for a nice description of which apps are targeted this time. You can stop with rumors for the follower of Leopard, all you have to do is take a look at the independent apps that are getting famous now: They are the next to be obliterated.<br /><br />So, basically, this is how it goes. Independent developers have the inovative ideas, and implement them for Mac OS X. Some of them are successfull, get lots of users, and start giving those developers a way of living. Since they are successfull, they get Apple attention. And Apple, instead of buying them (the right thing to do), makes a copycat of their software with a fancy name, and shows it at MacWorld. Since they will ship it with every <strike>PC</strike> Mac, they obliterate the former apps usefullness. Independent developers get ripped-off, see their source of income void, and they can't do anything about it, since Apple is the one who has the big bucks and the big lawyers.<br /><br />And that's iLife.

title: CPU upgrade
---

Today <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> made an upgrade to the cpus of the recently born <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook pro</a>, giving also an option of upgrading the top one to a even greater speed for $300.<br /><br />This news wouldn't deserve any comment from me, if it weren't for the reaction of some people (which I was allready guessing). In a few moments, the internet will be filled with posts and comments saying this is a bad thing. Not because the optional upgrade of 166Mhz costs so much ($300), but because they upgraded the cpus so early! And Apple can't do that, because that's the PC way!<br /><br />Whatever. I think it is a good thing, and I hope they keep doing it. It's much better to buy a computer that has the best cpu available at the time, than having to wait several months to see a new upgrade, while everybody else is carrying on. Now, we can buy a Apple computer at any time without fear of seeing a much better version appear next month. Way to go Apple!

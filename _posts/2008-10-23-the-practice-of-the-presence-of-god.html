title: The practice of the presence of God
---

<a href="http://www.practicegodspresence.com/brotherlawrence/practicegodspresence08.html">The practice of the presence of God</a> is a very well known classic of the Christian faith. It collects some of the insights given by Brother Lawrence, a friar that impressed people with the peace he transmitted. It's a great book to make us remember that the presence of God is not far from us, even when we are busy in our daily lives.<br /><br />I can not say I agree with everything on that book, but the main theme is of much value to me.

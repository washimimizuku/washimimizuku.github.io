title: Subjection vs Obedience
---

<i>"How does subjection differ from obedience? Subjection is an attitude. Obedience is an action. Subjection is absolute. Obedience is relative. Subjection is unconditional. Obedience is conditional. Subjection is an internal matter. Obedience is an external matter.<br /><br />God summons us to have a spirit of humble subjection toward those whom He has placed in authority in the natural order. Yet we must not obey them if they command us to do that which violates His will. For the authority of God is higher than any earthly authority"</i> (Frank Viola in Who Is Your Covering?, p.71)

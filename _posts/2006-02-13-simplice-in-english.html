title: Simplice in english
---

English readers deserve to read my blog too! So today I'll be launching the english version of Simplice.<br /><br />Simplice is latin for simple, and the purpose of this blog is to show how I search for simplicity in the various facets of my life. The simplicity we get when we get rid of all that is not necessary. I hope this turns out to be usefull to someone.

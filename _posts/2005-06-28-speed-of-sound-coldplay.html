How long before I get in? <br />Before it starts, before I begin? <br />How long before you decide? <br />Before I know what it feels like? <br />Where to, where do I go? <br />If you never try, then you'll never know. <br />How long do I have to climb, <br />Up on this side of this mountain of mine? <br /><br />Look up, I look up at night, <br />Planets are moving at the speed of light. <br />Climb up, up in the trees, <br />every chance that you get, <br />is a chance you seize. <br />How long am I gonna stand, <br />with my head stuck under the sand? <br />I’ll start before I can stop, <br />or before I see things the right way up. <br /><br />And all that noise and all that sound, <br />all those spaces I have found. <br />And birds go flying at the speed of sound, <br />to show you how it all began. <br />Birds came flying from the underground, <br />if you could see it then you'd understand… <br /><br />Ideas that you'll never find, <br />all the inventors could never design. <br />The buildings that you put up, <br />Japan and China all lit up. <br />The sign that I couldn't read, <br />or a light that I couldn't see, <br />some things you have to believe, <br />but others are puzzles, puzzling me. <br /><br />And all that noise, all that sound, <br />all those spaces I have found. <br />And birds go flying at the speed of sound, <br />to show you how it all began. <br />Birds come flying from the underground, <br />if you could see it then you'd understand, <br />Oh when you see it then you'll understand… <br /><br />All those signs, I knew what they meant. <br />Some things you can invent. <br />Some get made, and some get sent, <br />Ooh… <br />and Birds go flying at the speed of sound, <br />to show you how it all began. <br />Birds came flying from the underground, <br />if you could see it then you'd understand, <br />oh, when you see it then you'll understand…

title: 'Bushido: The Way of the Samurai by Tsunetomo Yamamoto'
---

Bushido starts with the phrase: "I have found the essence of Bushido: to die!" What it means, is that a samurai has to die to itself every day in order to be of service. And so starts a serious of practical sugestions of how a samurai should act.<br /><br />Two things fascinated me in this book. First, it helped me understand a little bit of the japanese culture. We can see that this book had some influence in the japanese way of working, doing business, relating to each other, etc.<br /><br />The second thing that fascinated me was the similarity between some of the principles in Bushido and the principles of the christian faith. The essence of Bushido, to die to ourselves, is one of the most important principles of christianity (the kind that is lived, not the religious kind).<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book, it's well worth it for anyone interested in Japan. And many of the advices in tha book are pertinent to our days, and worthy of being analized. Well worth the time.

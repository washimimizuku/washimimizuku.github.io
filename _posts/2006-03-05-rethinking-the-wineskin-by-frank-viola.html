title: Rethinking the Wineskin by Frank Viola
---

<i>"Far from being a body or a family, the church for most of us is an organization or an institution. The contrast between the institutional shape of the contemporary church and the relational shape of the first-century church could hardly be more striking."</i> (Hal Miller)<br /><br />In this way, Hal Miller sets the stage for this wondefull book. The church has become a mere shadow of what it once was, creating the need of books like these.<br /><br />Frank Viola talks about the church. How the church is, how it should be, and more important, how to change it. He talks about many things: The way the church is organized, the way it meets, leadership, purpose, location, fellowship. In a sense, everything that pertains to the life of the church. Because of that, the book doesn't go much deep in many of those subjects, that is left for the following 4 books in this series. This things just set the scenery for the need for change in the church.<br /><br />After showing in so many ways what needs to change, he shows "five principles that are essencial to any work that is seeking to recover God's fullest thought":<br /><br />1. A Fresh Revelation (of the church as God sees it)<br />2. A Paradigm Shift (from Institutional to biblical)<br />3. The Centrality and Supremacy of Christ<br />4. Counting the cost (this will be no easy path)<br />5. Travailing prayer (Everything starts with prayer)<br /><br />I believe this is a must read book for the church of our days. It touches deep in our faults. The question is: Are you ready for it?

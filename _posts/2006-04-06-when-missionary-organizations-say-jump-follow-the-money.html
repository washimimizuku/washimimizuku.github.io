title: 'When missionary organizations say jump: Follow the money'
---

A rule I have learned with time is this: If you want to understand what kind of community a missionary will create, follow the money. Where does the money come from? What kind of churches or organizations are funding the mission?<br /><br />Some people may say: No, if you want to know how the community will be like, you have to see the background of the missionary. Well, in my experience, as strange as it may sound, money speaks louder than the missionary tradition. If the missionary as a vision, and the ones funding have another, the missionary will be oscilating between the two, and end up being "convinced" or substituted.<br /><br />Beware of money with strings attached, you may not like those strings. If some organization is sending you, they will tell you when to jump and how high, and you may not like the game. If for some reason the vision God gives you changes while you are in the mission field (and that will probably happen), you'll have no say on it. They will say jump and you'll have no option but to do it. And that will create great stress on you.<br /><br />You want to have freedom in the way you plant churches? Get funded the opposite way. Discover where God wants to send you and what kind of church he wants you to plant, and then present the project to churches or people that might support you. And if it's not enough, get a job in the country you are going to. But do not accept money from people that will try to force their own vision on you. It's better to have to work in a secular job than to have to put up with the stress of pleasing people that don't have the same vision you do.<br /><br />Why do you need this freedom? It's not so you can do your thing, it's so you can do what God really wants. Because you are the one in the field, you are the one that will start to understand what kind of strategy is needed. You are the one God will be dealing with. And you don't want to get to a position where you have two lords: God, and the missionary organization.

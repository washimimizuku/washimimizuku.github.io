title: Boot Camp
---

Everyone seems to be freaking out because of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a>. Relax, folks. It's not the end of the world.<br /><br />What's it all about? Well, not only Apple is letting people install Microsoft Windows in Apple hardware, Apple is actually helping them! So, yes, if you have a Intel Mac, you can use Windows in your Mac. That would be completely dumb, but hey, the world is full of different things for weird people. You can as well shoot your own foot.<br /><br />This might even be good news for Apple fans. First, Windows <strike>loosers</strike> users can buy Apple hardware to run it, and actually pay Apple for it. Second, people will finally be able to compare the performance of each system in the same hardware and discover (surprise surprise) that Microsoft is a piece of junk. They might even "switch". Third, you'll be able to play <a href="http://www.andrewrussellstudios.com/wsu/">Stick Soldiers</a> in a Mac.

title: 'When missionary organizations say jump: We are family'
---

Christianity has everything to do with family, and nothing to do with business. It makes me sad when people forget all about it and start looking at mission work like if it were a business.<br /><br />When I start earing language like "targets", "5 year plan", "percentage of efectiveness", "expected growth", I start geting all hitchy. Lighten up, people! That's not even in your hands! All you have to do is live in obedience to God. It's the Holy Spirit that works in people. And if you are doing your own plans, then you are on your own. God likes planning his own work. Maybe this is why so many missionaries and pastors get stressed, depressed, and run havoc.<br /><br />And then there are meetings. And meetings. And more meetings. And they are all formal, all about objectives and planning, all boring. Where is the love? The relationships? Are we just a bunch of people that get together to make a project happen? Is that the only thing that connects us? If that's it, forget about results, you are allready a failure.<br /><br />Get a life. No, really. A family life. Meet people, get to know them, create real relationships with the people involved. Love them. And when you get to a point where you are together independent from the "project", then you have conditions to start doing something. Imagine the project died, would you still be with them? Let me ask it in another way. Do you meet with others frequently just to hang out? Are those relationships self-preserving, or they exists only because of a project?<br /><br />Be a family, the rest will follow.

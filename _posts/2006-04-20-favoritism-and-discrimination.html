title: Favoritism and Discrimination
---

<i>"If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers."</i> (James 2:8,9)<br /><br />Yesterday, studying the letter of James, chapter 2, we started talking about favoritism, and ended up talking about discrimination, and how both things reflect lack of humility. And we had to admit that many times we discriminate between ourselves. Just some examples:<br /><br />- How many women are theologians?<br />- Can we honestly say that in our community we give the same importance to women when they speak that we give to men?<br />- Do we love equally the person with the same hobbies we have and the ones with different hobbies?<br />- Do we serve the smelly ones the same way we do the others?

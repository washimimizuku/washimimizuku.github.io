title: Backslider
---

There is a kind of behaviour that is demanded by the church. If someone deviates from that behaviour, that person becomes a backslider. He is no longer christian (or never was, depending on your theology). And this kind of atitude creates a theoretical line called "point of no return".<br /><br />For example, a "true" christian is expected not to drink. So, if someone drinks a glass of wine, that person is allready a backslider, even if the Bible doesn't condemn it. And the atitude of the church towards that person changes imediatelly.<br /><br />That is BAD. Why? Well, it doesn't help, does it? It only makes the person feel guilty. And probably it helps the person to leave, since a huge artificial separation is created. You were a true believer, but now you are a backslider! Well, that's just stupid. It only helps creating hypochrisy, and the ones that need help are just discarded.

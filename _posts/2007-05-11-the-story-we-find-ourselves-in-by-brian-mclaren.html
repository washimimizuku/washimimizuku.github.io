title: The Story We Find Ourselves In by Brian McLaren
---

With the same style, this is a continuation of A New Kind of Christian. And a worthy one indeed.<br /><br />We could say that the main theme of the book is the creation/evolution debate, and although it is a recurrent subject in the book, the main theme is the story of the universe. The story of how God created the universe, and how he intervened in it, and how we fit in that story.<br /><br />I think this one is better than the first book in the triology. I think its very important to know how to tell the story of life in terms that the people of our days understands them. And the way it shows why you should care about nature, is excelent.<br /><br />The book might be polemic not only because of emergent theology, but also because it defends that God created earth by evolution. Not that it's polemic to me, but it might be to some :)

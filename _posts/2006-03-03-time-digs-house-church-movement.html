title: Time digs House Church Movement
---

Through <a href="http://edkieb.blogspot.com/2006/03/house-churches.html">Eric</a> I found a Time Magazina article called <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1167737,00.html">There's No Pulpit Like Home</a>. The article is about the rising popularity of house churches. It's interesting to see a magazine like Time talking about this movement. A sign of the times?

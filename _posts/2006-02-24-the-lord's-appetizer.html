title: The Lord's Appetizer
---

<i>"It is no longer the Lord's Supper. Today it would better be called the (...) Lord's Appetizer! I am sorry, but we can hardly call a cracker crumb and a shotglass of juice a supper!"</i> (Frank Viola in Rethinking the Wineskin, p.45)<br /><br />Having experienced the Lord's Supper as a real meal, I can really understand this frase. Its not only the size of the meal that has been minimized. Everything about the Lord's Supper in the modern church is a mere glimpse of what it's supposed to be, of what the early church has experienced. It is impossible to experience the same fellowship, the same equality, the same meaning the early church experienced while silently having a small cracker! It's like having a fast food Christmas dinner alone!<br /><br />Bring back the food to the Lord's Supper! Bring back the round table! We urgently need the fellowship, equality and meaning it brings.

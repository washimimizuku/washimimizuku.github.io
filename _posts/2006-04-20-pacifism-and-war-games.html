title: Pacifism and war games
---

You may wonder why a pacifist like me can like strategy war games like Axis & Allies. Well, I don't have an answer for that. I only know that I do. And in some way that just shows that I, like many people, have a violent nature.<br /><br />One of the reasons I believe in pacifism is because I can be a violent man myself. If we were not violent by nature, pacifism couldn't exist. How could we define pacifism if there was no agression? Why would we talk about peace if war and violence were not present in the world? War and violence is part of our bad nature, and we have to fight against it, but not with violence, of course.<br /><br />I wish there was no such thing as pacifism, because that meant there was no such things as war or violence. But that's not the world we live in.

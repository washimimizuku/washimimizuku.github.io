title: Back from Genève
---

Just came back from Genève, where I had an excellent time this weekend.<br /><br />Friday was the day to go to a job interview, and to finally meet <a href="http://companion.blogs.com/">Lammert</a> and his family. Had great conversations with them, it was great. Love them all.<br /><br />On Saturday I went to an <a href="http://en.arocha.org">A Rocha</a> conference, where I got to meet the people behind <a href="http://fr.arocha.org/suisse/">A Rocha Suisse</a>. The conference went well, I think it was a success for a first one in Switzerland. The subjects discussed where kind of more basic then I thought they would be, but well... I think there is lot's of potential on the projects they have for the future, and I will love to help that potential to become reality. In the end of the day, I had a little time to walk around Genève downtown. That was great, I missed Genève a lot since February, and was great to be there again.<br /><br />On Sunday I got to walk around the place where the two rivers meet. Beautifull place, it's like a forest inside town. Amazing. At lunch I got to meet some of the people at <a href="http://shemacommunity.typepad.com/">Shema</a> and <a href="http://www.engage-geneva.com/">Engage</a>, including <a href="http://www.joshuacase.net/">Joshua</a> (it was nice to finally meet him in person).<br /><br />I was in the plane to Portugal, and was allready missing Genève...

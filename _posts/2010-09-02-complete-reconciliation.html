(Colossians 1:20 ISV)<br /><br />It saddens me when I see followers of Jesus Christ disrespecting God's creation. I see it as a disrespect towards God, creator of all thing, and a disrespect towards others, since everyone will suffer the effects of those actions.<br /><br />The Bible is filled with passages that show that God cares about the environment. He so cares about all of it's creation, that he redeemed all creation (not only humans) by the sacrifice of His son Jesus. It's only our tradition of disregard for the environment that makes us blind to that fact.<br /><br />If all creation praises God (Psalm 69:34), then by destroying it we are doing the opposite of praising Him. If we are commanded to love our neighbour (Mark 12:31), then by robbing future generations of the blessings of biodiversity we are not loving at all. We are not loving the polinesians that are losing their islands due to global warming. Nor loving the people that die every day because of pollution.<br /><br />Ultimately, the care for the environment is a question of love. Of loving nature, but also of loving our neighbours, and above all God.

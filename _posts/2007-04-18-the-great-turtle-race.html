title: The Great Turtle Race
---

The <a href="http://www.greatturtlerace.com/">Great Turtle Race</a> is an amazing website! You can follow the migration of eleven Leatherback Turtles from Costa Rica to the Galapagos Islands thanks to a satellite tracking system. And the flash interface is awesome. I hope this gets done for bird species in the future...
